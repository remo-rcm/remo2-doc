  Abstract                 = {Summary Two climate model simulations made with the Rossby Centre regional Atmospheric model version 1 (RCA1) are evaluated for the precipitation climate in Scania, southernmost Sweden. These simulations are driven by the HadCM2 and the ECHAM4/OPYC3 global circulation models (GCMs) for 10 years. Output from the global and the regional simulations are compared with an observational data set, constructed from a dense precipitation gauge network in Scania. Area-averaged time series corresponding to the size and location of the RCA1 grid points in Scania have been created (the Scanian Data Set). This data set was compared to a commonly used gridded surface climatology provided by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU). Relatively large differences were found, mainly due to the fact that the CRU-climatology uses fewer stations and lacks a correction for rain-gauge under-catch. This underlines the importance of the data set chosen for model evaluations. The validation is carried out at a large scale including the whole area of Scania and at the finest resolution of RCA1 (the grid point level). When integrated over the whole area of Scania, RCA1 improves the shape of the annual precipitation cycle and the inter-annual variability compared to output from the GCMs. The RCA1 control climate is generally too wet compared to the observations. At the grid point level, RCA1 improves the simulation of the variability compared to the GCMs. There is a strong positive correlation between precipitation and altitude in all seasons in the observations. This relationship is, however, much weaker and even reversed in the RCA1 simulations. Analysis of the dense rain gauge network reveals features of spatial variability at around 20&#8211;35?km in the area and indicates that a finer resolution is needed if the spatial variability in the area is to be better captured by RCA1.},

Intercontinental transport and hemispheric air pollution by ozone jeopardize agricultural and natural ecosystems worldwide and have a strong effect on climate. Aerosols, which are spread globally but have a strong regional imbalance, change global climate through their direct and indirect effects on radiative forcing. In the 1990s, nitrogen oxide emissions from Asia surpassed those from North America and Europe and should continue to exceed them for decades. International initiatives to mitigate global air pollution require participation from both developed and developing countries.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents results of an assessment of the linkages between regional air pollution and climate change in Europe (the AIR-CLIM Project). The main research tool was an integrated modeling framework and the main product was a consistent set of long-term scenarios covering Europe between 1995 and 2100. Scenarios consisted of trends in emissions, acid deposition, nitrogen deposition and climate change. Critical loads and critical levels were used to assess the impacts of deposition to forest soils and a new analogous concept of #critical##climate##change# was developed to assess the impacts of climate change. Taking into consideration the limitations of the scope and models used in the study, preliminary conclusions were: (1) regional air pollution and climate change may be fairly weakly coupled in the natural environment, i.e. climate change was not found to have a large impact on the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to regional air pollution, nor on the distribution of deposition; nor did regional air pollution (in the form of sulfate aerosols) have a significant impact on climate change in Europe; (2) however, regional air pollution and climate change may be strongly coupled in the #policy# environment. It was estimated that virtually all of Europe at mid-century might be affected by either regional air pollution or climate change, or both, and this will require a strong policy response. Moreover, the indirect effects of climate policies were found to reduce the costs of controlling air pollution emissions by more than 50%, suggesting a strong potential financial linkage between policies to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions.},

  Abstract                 = {Transport-induced interannual variability of carbon monoxide (CO) is studied during 1989â1993 using the Goddard chemistry and transport model (GCTM) driven by assimilated data. Seasonal changes in the latitudinal distribution of CO near the surface and at 500 hPa are captured by the model. The annual cycle of CO is reasonably well simulated at sites of widely varying character. Day to day fluctuations in CO due to synoptic waves are reproduced accurately at remote North Atlantic locations. By fixing the location and magnitude of chemical sources and sinks, the importance of transport-induced variability is investigated at CO-monitoring sites. Transport-induced variability can explain 1991â1993 decreases in CO at Mace Head, Ireland, and St. David's Head, Bermuda, as well as 1991â1993 increases in CO at Key Biscayne, Florida. Transport-induced variability does not explain decreases in CO at southern hemisphere locations. The model calculation explains 80â90% of interannual variability in seasonal CO residuals at Mace Head, St. David's Head, and Key Biscayne and at least 50% of variability in detrended seasonal residuals at Ascension Island and Guam. Upper tropospheric interannual variability during October is less than 8% in the GCTM. Exceptions occur off the western coast of South America, where mixing ratios are sensitive to the strength of an upper tropospheric high, and just north of Madagascar, where concentrations are influenced by the strength of offshore flow from Africa.},

Suppression of low-level rainout and aerosol washout allows transport of water and smoke to upper levels, where the clouds appear "smoking" as they detrain much of the pollution. Elevating the onset of precipitation allows invigoration of the updrafts, causing intense thunderstorms, large hail, and greater likelihood for overshooting cloud tops into the stratosphere. There, detrained pollutants and water vapor would have profound radiative impacts on the climate system. The invigorated storms release the latent heat higher in the atmosphere. This should substantially affect the regional and global circulation systems. Together, these processes affect the water cycle, the pollution burden of the atmosphere, and the dynamics of atmospheric circulation.},

However, care must be taken to ensure that rate and process information is not confounded by inappropriate averaging over these diurnally changing photochemical dynamics. One probe, the [O3] response surface probe [O3]/[NOX], is used here as a chemical filter to select NOX-limited hours in the observations and the simulations. Other probes used here are the fraction NOZ/NOY, a measure of chemical aging, and a measure of the production efficiency of O3 per NOX converted, [O3] to [NOZ]. The key ambient measurements for all three probes are accurate [NO2] and a reliable estimate of total NOY. Good agreement is shown between models and observations in cases where local photochemical production dominates and where model emissions inputs are thought to be mostly complete. We interpret this agreement to mean that the photochemical processing in CMAQ is substantially similar to that in the atmosphere. More importantly, we see that the three probes provide consistent information about photochemical processing, especially when used together.},

Further, we found that enhanced greenhouse forcing resulted in overall suppression of summer precipitation, a delay in monsoon onset, and an increase in the occurrence of monsoon break periods. Weakening of the large-scale monsoon flow and suppression of the dominant intraseasonal oscillatory modes were instrumental in the overall weakening of the South Asian summer monsoon. Such changes in monsoon dynamics could have substantial impacts by decreasing summer precipitation in key areas of South Asia.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of continental outflow on the ozone chemical tendencies (i.e., production and loss rates) is quantified in the North Atlantic and northwest Pacific regions using the GEOS-Chem and the MOZECH global models of chemistry and transport. The ozone tendencies simulated by these global models are compared to box model simulations constrained by observations in different regions and seasons. The two global models generally capture the seasonal and regional variations of the ozone tendencies. The largest discrepancies between the ozone tendencies from the box model and those from the global models are found in the lower troposphere of the eastern North Atlantic during the ACSOE campaign and are attributed to differences between chemical schemes and too strong NOx concentrations in the global models. The background and plume (i.e., impacted by continental outflow) environments are differentiated over the oceanic areas using criteria based on simulated daily mean CO concentrations. The ozone tendencies in the plume environment differ from that in the background over the entire column in North Atlantic and northwest Pacific at all seasons. According to the models, net ozone production is enhanced by 2 to 6 ppbv/day in the boundary layer and by 1 to 3 ppbv/ day in the upper troposphere, whereas the effect of pollution ranges from -1 ppbv/day to +1 ppbv/day in the middle troposphere (3-7 km), depending on the model used. The different responses of the two models are determined by differences in the water vapor distributions relative to those of pollutants in the plumes. In particular, GEOS-Chem tends to transport pollution in a drier sector of cyclones than MOZECH.},

  Abstract                 = {To improve urban air quality the major industrialized nations of the West took steps during the 1970s and 1980s to reduce carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from automobiles and other industrial sources. Overall, CO/CO2 emission ratios from the mix of fossil fuel combustion sources have been reduced by about half during 1976-1990. Also, the tropospheric abundance of hydroxyl radical (OH), which is the main sink for CO, is proposed to have increased globally by about 1.0+/-0.8% yr-1 [Prinn et al., 1992]. We use a simple two-box model to examine the impact of shrinking emissions and increasing, OH on the global abundance of CO. We find that these factors contribute about equally in reducing CO levels in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere by about l.8+/-0.8 ppb yr-l on average. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper summarizes the development of a convergent weighted-averaging interpolation scheme which can be used to obtain any desired amount of detail in the analysis of a set of randomly spaced data. The scheme is based on the supposition that the two-dimensional distribution of an atmospheric variable can be represented by the summation of an infinite number of independent waves, i.e., a Fourier integral representation. The practical limitations of the scheme are that the data distribution be reasonably uniform and that the data be accurate. However, the effect of inaccuracies can be controlled by stopping the convergence scheme before the data errors are greatly amplified. The scheme has been tested in the analysis of 500-mb height data over the United States producing a result with details comparable to those obtainable by careful manual analysis. A test analysis of sea level pressure based on the data obtained at only the upper air network stations produced results with essentially the same features as the analysis produced at the National Meteorological Center. Further tests based on a regional sampling of stations reporting airways data demonstrate the applicability of the scheme to mesoscale wavelengths.},

  Abstract                 = {A conceptual study of climate feedbacks is carried out using two simple linear two-zone models and the commonly-used zero-dimensional model to which they reduce under simplifying assumptions. The term 'feedback' is used in many different senses in the climate literature. Two prototype usages, stability-altering feedback (defined in terms of a system's asymptotic response to an impulsive forcing, negative when stability-enhancing) and sensitivity-altering feedback (defined in terms of a system's steady-state response to a step-function forcing, negative when sensitivity-diminishing) have been isolated for study. These two climate feedback concepts are viewed against the background of control theory, which provides a generalized feedback perspective embracing all forms of forcing and which is often seen as providing the paradigm for the concept of feedback as used in climate studies. The relationship between the prototype climate feedbacks is simple in the context of the zero-dimensional model. Here, the stability-altering and sensitivity-altering feedbacks provided by a given interaction are of the same sign, and the sign of the stability-altering feedback as measured by initial tendencies always coincides with its sign as measured by the defining asymptotic tendencies. Even in this simple model, however, the sign of the prototype climate feedbacks can be opposite to the sign of the system's feedback as defined in control theory. In the two-zone models, the relationship between the prototype climate feedbacks is not so simple. It is shown that, contrary to the common assumption, these feedbacks can be of opposite signs. Moreover, the sign of the stability-altering feedback as measured by initial tendencies can be opposite to its sign as measured by asymptotic tendencies. It is further shown that there is no simple relationship between the sign of either of the prototype climate feedbacks in the two-zone models and the sign of these models' feedback as defined in control theory. These results point to the need for greater precision and explicitness in the definition and use of the term 'climate feedback', both to facilitate interdisciplinary dialogue in relation to feedback and to guard against erroneous inferences within the climate field. Explicit definitions of the two prototype categories of climate feedback studied here are proposed. Copyright (C) 2007 Royal Meteorological Society.},

A successive order of scattering methodology is employed to obtain exact and approximate equations of the rain medium in order to evaluate the contribution of the different scattering orders to the polarization signal for a ID geometry approximation at all cloud levels. Then a Monte Carlo technique is used to evaluate the impact of 3D effects in the polarization of the downwelling/upwelling radiation field at the bottom/top of the dichroic layer. An accurate analysis of the impact of the emission term onto the total polarization signal is carried out. The 3D effects seem to be more relevant in polarization signatures when the emission/absorption processes dominate. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Nitrogen oxides ( NO+ NO2 = NOx and reservoir species) are important trace gases in the troposphere with impact on human health, atmospheric chemistry and climate. Besides natural sources ( lightning, soil emissions) and biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion is estimated to be responsible for about 50\% of the total production of NOx. Since human activity in industrialized countries largely follows a seven- day cycle, fossil fuel combustion is expected to be reduced during weekends. This `` weekend effect{''} is well known from local, ground based measurements, but has never been analysed on a global scale before. The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment ( GOME) on board the ESA- satellite ERS- 2 allows measurements of NO2 column densities. By estimating and subtracting the stratospheric column, and considering radiative transfer, vertical column densities ( VCD) of tropospheric NO2 can be determined ( e. g. Leue et al., 2001). We demonstrate the statistical analysis of weekly cycles of tropospheric NO2 VCDs for different regions of the world. In the cycles of the industrialized regions and cities in the US, Europe and Japan a clear Sunday minimum of tropospheric NO2 VCD can be seen. Sunday NO2 VCDs are about 25 - 50\% lower than working day levels. Metropolitan areas with other religious and cultural backgrounds ( Jerusalem, Mecca) show different weekly patterns corresponding to different days of rest. In China, no weekly pattern can be found. The presence of a weekly cycle in the measured tropospheric NO2 VCD may help to identify the different anthropogenic source categories. Furthermore, we estimated the lifetime of tropospheric NO2 by analysing the mean weekly cycle exemplarily over Germany, obtaining a value of about 6 h in summer and 18 - 24 h in winter.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated how climate change could affect ambient ozone concentrations
and the subsequent human health impacts. Hourly concentrations were estimated for 50
eastern US cities for five representative summers each in the 1990s and 2050s, reflecting
current and projected future climates, respectively. Estimates of future concentrations were
based on the IPCC A2 scenario using global climate, regional climate, and regional air
quality models. This work does not explore the effects of future changes in anthropogenic
emissions, but isolates the impact of altered climate on ozone and health. The cities’ ozone
levels are estimated to increase under predicted future climatic conditions, with the largest
increases in cities with present-day high pollution. On average across the 50 cities, the
summertime daily 1-h maximum increased 4.8 ppb, with the largest increase at 9.6 ppb. The
average number of days/summer exceeding the 8-h regulatory standard increased 68%.
Elevated ozone levels correspond to approximately a 0.11% to 0.27% increase in daily total
mortality. While actual future ozone concentrations depend on climate and other influences
such as changes in emissions of anthropogenic precursors, the results presented here
indicate that with other factors constant, climate change could detrimentally affect air quality
and thereby harm human health.},

  Abstract                 = {Although sulphur emissions (mainly as SO2) have been continuously decreasing over the last 20 years in most western industrialized countries, localized SO2 problems still exist in conjunction with strong local emission, meteorological, and topographical factors. In this study, the effect of supplementary installed flue gas desulphurization (FGD) units at high-capacity power plants on regional air pollution in the Carpathian Basin is investigated. The dispersion and accumulation of the SO2 air pollutant are studied with the regional three-dimensional on-line atmosphere-chemistry model REMOTE. The changes in the SO2 air pollution are investigated by parallel simulations in a case study, where the single modified parameter is the SO2 emission rate. The results show that FGD units significantly reduce the horizontal and the vertical dispersion of the emitted SO2, and its transboundary transport, too. Beside the SO2 removal efficiency, the dispersion and accumulation also depend on the seasonal weather conditions. During winter, the dispersion and accumulation are higher than in other seasons. Due to this phenomenon, higher SO2 removal efficiency is needed to guarantee similar air quality features like in the other seasons.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a study of the impact of initial concentrations on the modeling of photochemical oxidants. A simple impact model is employed, and an impact factor is defined which describes the ratio between the initial concentration and the time-dependent model concentration. The calculations have been carried out with data from a box model and a comprehensive three-dimensional (3-D) model. Results are for three different sites in the California San Joaquin Valley. By using data from the chemical box model a very active chemistry and rather high concentrations are obtained since no transport processes are included. The impact of the initial concentrations is small already after 24 hours of model integration under such conditions. Results from the more realistic 3-D data show that the impact factor is reduced to less than 10% within the planetary boundary layer after 48 hours for nearly all chemical components studied. An exception is the sum of selected grouped species of O-x + NO2 + NO3 + N2O5 + HNO3 + PAN (sum of reservoir species for O-3) which is not below 10% before approximately after 3 days at the two least polluted sites. In the free troposphere the impact factors of the initial concentrations are large even after 3 days for paraffin, ethene, and isoprene. For selected grouped species of O-x + NO2 and O-x + NO2 + NO3 + N2O5 + HNO3 + PAN, large impact factors are still found after 3 days. The large impact of the initial concentrations in the free troposphere strongly complicates any model evaluation by use of measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {The hydrometeorology of the Amazon basin in the ERA-40 reanalysis for 1958-2001 is compared with observations of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow. After 1979, the reanalysis over the Amazon has a small cool bias of the order of -0.35 K, and a small low bias of precipitation of the order of -0.3 mm day(-1). In the early years (1958-72), there is a large upward drift in reanalysis precipitation and runoff associated with an upward drift in the atmospheric water vapor in the analysis, and a somewhat smaller downward drift of temperature as precipitation increases. In the presatellite data, there are inhomogeneities in the radiosonde and surface synoptic data, and there were problems with the variational analysis of humidity once satellite radiances were introduced. Approximate bias corrections can be made for precipitation and runoff on an annual basis, but this also removes some of the interannual variability. The reanalysis runoff-precipitation relationship is similar to the observed streamflow-precipitation relation, on an annual water-year basis. Compared to observations, ERA-40 precipitation for the Amazon is low by about 1.3 mm day(-1) in the rainy season, and high by a smaller amount in the dry season. The precipitation bias produces a temperature bias in ERA-40 of the opposite sign on the annual time scale. The reanalysis has a small cold temperature bias after 1967, but on an annual time scale it reproduces the interannual variability of the observations. Although the biases in temperature and precipitation in recent decades are small, the difficulties with the analysis of atmospheric water vapor lead to large uncertainty in long-term trends of the water cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional climate models are becoming increasingly popular to provide high resolution climate change information for impacts assessments to inform adaptation options. Many countries and provinces requiring these assessments are as small as 200,000 km2 in size, significantly smaller than an ideal domain needed for successful applications of one-way nested regional climate models. Therefore assessments on sub-regional scales (e.g., river basins) are generally carried out using climate change simulations performed for relatively larger regions. Here we show that the seasonal mean hydrological cycle and the day-to-day precipitation variations of a sub-region within the model domain are sensitive to the domain size, even though the large scale circulation features over the region are largely insensitive. On seasonal timescales, the relatively smaller domains intensify the hydrological cycle by increasing the net transport of moisture into the study region and thereby enhancing the precipitation and local recycling of moisture. On daily timescales, the simulations run over smaller domains produce higher number of moderate precipitation days in the sub-region relative to the corresponding larger domain simulations. An assessment of daily variations of water vapor and the vertical velocity within the sub-region indicates that the smaller domains may favor more frequent moderate uplifting and subsequent precipitation in the region. The results remained largely insensitive to the horizontal resolution of the model, indicating the robustness of the domain size influence on the regional model solutions. These domain size dependent precipitation characteristics have the potential to add one more level of uncertainty to the downscaled projections.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the largest uncertainties for the modeling of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) concentration is the timing, location, and magnitude of biomass burning emissions. We investigate the sensitivity of simulated CO in the Unified Chemistry Transport Model (UCTM) to several biomass burning emissions, including four bottom-up and two top-down inventories. We compare the sensitivity experiments with observations from MOPITT, surface and airborne NOAA Global Monitoring Division network data, and the TRACE-P field campaign. The variation of the global annual emissions of these six biomass burning inventories is within 30 \%; however, their regional variations are often much higher (factor of 2-5). These uncertainties translate to about 6 \% variation in the global simulated CO but more than a 100 \% variation in some regions. The annual mean CO variation is greater in the Southern Hemisphere (>12 \%) than in the Northern Hemisphere (<5 \%), largely because biomass burning is a higher percentage of the total source in the Southern Hemisphere. Comparisons with CO observations indicate that each model inventory has its strengths and shortcomings, and these regional variations are examined. Overall the model CO concentrations are within the observed range of variability at most stations including Ascension Island, which is strongly influenced by fire emissions. In addition, we discuss the systematic biases that exist in the inventories developed by the similar methodologies and original satellite data.},

  Abstract                 = {We have applied the regional climate model REMO, which is based on the Europa-Modell (EM) of the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), to the Tropics. We have performed model runs using the so-called #nesting##technique#. Results of a Global Circulation Model (GCM) with a T42 horizontal resolution, driven by observed Sea Surface Temperatures (SST's) covering the time-span December 1982 to December 1983 are used as initial and boundary conditions. Before using regional model results as driving forces for impact models, the model results have to be carefully validated in several steps. Here, we focus on the ability of both models in reproducing the surface water balance within the land-covered part of the model area shown in Fig. 1 as well as within a diagnosis area in Northeastern Brazil (NEB). We compare the model-simulated components contributing to this balance with analysis data. As an example, observations from a location in Central Piauí are used to relate modelled and analysed precipitation to real data. Conclusions are drawn on requirements for improved physical parametrizations and modified initial and boundary conditions. From the model comparison, it becomes clear that a comprehensive validation of the regional model for climate impact research using observations will only be possible if changed experimental conditions are applied. Therefore, it is intended to provide initial and lateral boundary conditions from analysis data to the regional model and to use a parametrization package which includes a large scale precipitation scheme as applied in the global models ECHAM3 and ECHAM4 in future investigations.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] One of the main causes of the low efficiency in nitrogen (N) use by crops is the volatilization of ammonia (NH3) from fertilizers. Information taken from 1667 NH3 volatilization measurements documented in 148 research papers was summarized to assess the influence on NH3 volatilization of crop type, fertilizer type, and rate and mode of application and temperature, as well as soil organic carbon, texture, pH, CEC, measurement technique, and measurement location. The data set was summarized in three ways: (1) by calculating means for each of the factors mentioned, in which findings from each research paper were weighted equally; (2) by calculating weighted median values corrected for unbalanced features of the collected data; and (3) by developing a summary model using linear regression based on weighted median values for NH3 volatilization and by calculating global NH3 volatilization losses from fertilizer application using 0.5degrees resolution data on land use and soils. The calculated median NH3 loss from global application of synthetic N fertilizers (78 million tons N per year) and animal manure (33 million tons N per year) amount to 14% (10-19%) and 23% (19-29%), respectively. In developing countries, because of high temperatures and the widespread use of urea, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium bicarbonate, estimated NH3 volatilization loss from synthetic fertilizers amounts to 18%, and in industrialized countries it amounts to 7%. The estimated NH3 loss from animal manure is 21% in industrialized and 26% in developing countries.},

  Abstract                 = {A global emissions inventory for ammonia (NH3) has been compiled for the main known sources on a 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid, suitable for input to global atmospheric models. The estimated global emission for 1990 is about 54 Tg N yr(-1). The major sources identified include excreta from domestic animals (21.6 Tg N yr(-1)) and wild animals (0.1 Tg N yr(-1)), use of synthetic N fertilizers (9.0 Tg N yr(-1)), oceans (8.2 Tg N yr(-1)), biomass burning (5.9 Tg N yr(-1)), crops (3.6 Tg N yr(-1)), human population and pets (2.6 Tg N yr(-1)), soils under natural vegetation (2.4 Tg N yr(-1)), industrial processes (0.2 Tg N yr(-1)), and fossil fuels (0.1 Tg N yr(-1)). About half of the global emission comes from Asia, and about 70% is related to food production. The regions with highest emission rates are located in Europe, the Indian subcontinent, and China, reflecting the patterns of animal densities and type and intensity of synthetic fertilizer use. The overall uncertainty in the global emission estimate is 25%, while the uncertainty in regional emissions is much greater. As the global human population will show considerable growth in the coming decades, food production and associated NH3 emissions are likely to increase as well.},

  Abstract                 = {A global three-dimensional chemical transport model, called MOZART (Model of OZone And Related species in the Troposphere), is used to compare calculated abundances of chemical species and their seasonal evolution in the remote Pacific troposphere near Hawaii with values observed during the Mauna Loa Observatory Photochemistry Experiments (MLOPEX 1 and 2). MOZART is a fully diurnal model which calculates the time evolution of about 30 chemical species from the surface to the upper stratosphere. It accounts for surface emissions of source gases, wet and dry depositions, photochemical transformations and transport processes. The dynamical variables are provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM2) at T42 resolution (2.8 degrees x2.8 degrees) and 18 levels in the vertical. Simulated abundances of Rn-222 reveal an underestimate of the transport of continental emissions to the remote Pacific troposphere, more particularly during winter and summer. Calculated concentrations of chemical species are generally in fair agreement with observations. However, the abundances of soluble species are overestimated, leading, for example, to concentrations of nitric acid (HNO3) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which are overpredicted by a factor of 3-8, depending on the season. This feature is attributed to insufficient washout by clouds and precipitation in the model. MOZART succesfully reproduces the development of high-NOx episodes at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) associated with anticyclonic conditions to the north of Hawaii and breakdown of the polar jet which tends to deflect to the central Pacific the how of NOx transported from eastern Asia (China, Japan). During high NOx episodes, the calculated NOx mixing ratio in the vicinity of the MLO increases by about a factor of 3 over its background level (reaching 90-100 pptv) within 3-5 days. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a new global three-dimensional chemical-transport model (called MOZART) developed in the framework of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM) and aimed at studying the distribution and budget of tropospheric ozone and its precursors. The model, developed with a horizontal resolution of 2.8 degrees in longitude and latitude, includes 25 levels in the vertical between the Earth's surface and an upper boundary located at approximately 35 km altitude. In its present configuration the model calculates the global distribution of 56 chemical constituents with a timestep of 20 min, and accounts for surface emission and deposition, large-scale advective transport, subscale convective and boundary layer exchanges, chemical and photochemical transformations, as well as wet scavenging. Transport is simulated "off line" from CCM with dynamical variables provided every 3 hours from preestablished history tapes. Advection is calculated using the semi-Lagrangian transport scheme [Rasch and Williamson, 1990] developed for the MATCH model of Rasch et al. [1997]. Convective and boundary layer transports are expressed according to Hack [1994] and Holtslag and Boville [1993], respectively. A detailed evaluation of the model results is provided in a companion paper [Hauglustaine et al., this issue]. An analysis of the spatial and temporal variability in the chemical fields predicted by the model suggests that regional events such as summertime ozone episodes in polluted areas can be simulated by MOZART.},

  Abstract                 = {Calculations by a global three-dimensional chemical transport model of the atmosphere suggest that increased surface emissions of chemical compounds caused by industrial activities at mid-latitudes in the northern hemisphere and by biomass burning in the tropics since the middle of the 19th century have produced an increase in the abundance of tropospheric ozone along with a reduction in the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere (globally averaged OH concentration reduced by 17% and methane lifetime enhanced by 1.5 years). These perturbations in tropospheric ozone result in a change in annually averaged radiative forcing of 0.37 W m(-2) (0.62 W m(-2) in the northern hemisphere during the summer months). Future changes (1990-2050) in tropospheric ozone associated with population increase and economic development (primarily in developing countries) are expected to be largest in the tropics, specifically in South and Southeast Asia. Further changes in the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere could be small if the abundance of tropospheric water vapor increases as a result of anticipated climate change. },

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional model calculations suggest that the world's fleet of subsonic aircraft has enhanced the abundance of nitrogen oxides in the upper troposphere by up to 20-35% and has produced a significant increase in the ozone concentration in this region of the atmosphere (4% in summer and 1% in winter). In year 2050, on the basis of current scenarios for growth in aviation, the concentration of NOx at 10 km could increase by 30-60% at midlatitudes, and the concentration of ozone could be enhanced by 7% and 2% in summer and winter, respectively (relative to a situation without aircraft effects). The perturbation is not limited to the flight corridors but affects the entire northern hemisphere. The magnitude (and even the sign) of the ozone change depends on the level of background atmospheric NOx and hence on NOx sources (lightning, intrusion from the stratosphere, and convective transport from the polluted boundary layer) and sinks which are poorly quantified in this region of the atmosphere. On the basis of our model estimates, 20% of the NOx found at 10 km (midlatitudes) is produced by aircraft engines, 25% originates from the surface (combustion and soils), and approximately 50% is produced by lightning. For a lightning source enhanced in the model by a factor of 2, the increase in NOx and ozone at 10 lan due to aircraft emissions, is reduced by a factor of 2. The magnitude of aircraft perturbations in NOx is considerably smaller than the uncertainties in other NOx sources. },

  Abstract                 = {A global chemical transport model of the atmosphere [the Model for Ozone and Related Tracers, version 2 (MOZART-2)] driven by prescribed surface emissions and by meteorological fields provided by the ECHAM5/Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPI-OM-1) coupled atmosphere-ocean model is used to assess how expected climate changes (2100 versus 2000 periods) should affect the chemical composition of the troposphere. Calculations suggest that ozone changes resulting from climate change only are negative in a large fraction of the troposphere because of enhanced photochemical destruction by water vapor. In the Tropics, increased lightning activity should lead to larger ozone concentrations. The magnitude of the climate-induced ozone changes in the troposphere remains smaller than the changes produced by enhanced anthropogenic emissions when the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2P is adopted to describe the future evolution of these emissions. Predictions depend strongly on future trends in atmospheric methane levels, which are not well established. Changes in the emissions of NOx by bacteria in soils and of nonmethane hydrocarbons by vegetation associated with climate change could have a significant impact on future ozone levels. },

  Abstract                 = {Carbon monoxide (CO) measurements from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) experiment are used to explore the correlation between biomass burning and ozone profiles at six tropical stations namely Reunion, Irene, Natal, Ascension, San Cristobal, and Paramaribo. Distinct seasonal patterns of CO at each station indicate the strong influence of African and South American biomass burning. All stations show enhanced CO columns during September-November ( SON) corresponding to austral burning. Furthermore, the effects of Sahelian burning can be seen at Natal and Ascension. Similarly, the signature of northern Amazonian fires can be observed at San Cristobal. The CO variations are generally similar to the variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved contemporaneously from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at most stations, with notable differences at Irene, San Cristobal, and Paramaribo. Tropospheric ozone from Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesonde (SHADOZ) ozonesonde measurements at all stations show elevated levels, corresponding to the CO enhancements in SON months. However, there are several instances of ozone enhancements unaccompanied by any CO increase. This might indicate that sources other than biomass burning such as stratospheric tropospheric exchange (STE) or lightning related NOx may be operative. At San Cristobal, strong CO enhancements during March April are not accompanied by any significant change in ozone.},

  Abstract                 = {Several approaches to parameterize the turbulent transport of momentum, heat, water vapour and cloud water for use in a general circulation model (GCM) have been tested in 1-dimensional and 3-dimensional model simulations. The schemes differ with respect to their closure assumptions (conventional eddy diffusivity model versus turbulent kinetic energy closure) and also regarding their treatment of cloud-turbulence interactions. The basic properties of these parameterizations are discussed first in relation to column simulations of a stratocumulus-topped atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) under a strong subsidence inversion during the KONTROL experiment in the North Sea. It is found that the K-models tend to decouple the cloud layer from adjacent layers above and below because the turbulent activity is calculated from local variables. The higher-order scheme performs better in this respect because internally generated turbulence can be transported up and down through the action of turbulent diffusion. Thus, the TKE-scheme provides not only a better link between the cloud and the sub-cloud layer but also between the cloud and the inversion as a result of cloud-top entrainment. In the stratocumulus case study, where the cloud is confined by a pronounced subsidence inversion, increased entrainment favours cloud dilution through enhanced evaporation of cloud droplets. In the GCM study, however, additional cloud-top entrainment supports cloud formation because indirect cloud generating processes are promoted through efficient ventilation of the ABL, such as the enhanced moisture supply by surface evaporation and the increased depth of the ABL. As a result, tropical convection is more vigorous, the hydrological cycle is intensified, the whole troposphere becomes warmer and moister in general and the cloudiness in the upper part of the ABL is increased.},

The model with the new numerics has been tested against the standard scheme in several 3-D climate model simulations which differ with respect to the location of the tracer source. Typical difference patterns associated with the prescribed tracer source can be noticed from the results. In the case of a strong surface source, the upward transport away from the surface tends to be reduced with the new scheme compared to the standard scheme. However, in the case of atmospheric tracer sources at an upper tropospheric level the upward transport above the source and downward below it are both enhanced. A student-t test confirms that these difference patterns are highly significant (99 %).},

  Abstract                 = {In recent generation Earth system models (ESMs), land-surface grid cells are represented as tiles covered by different plant functional types such as trees or grasses. Here, we present an evaluation of the vegetation-cover module of the ESM developed at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany (MPI-ESM) for present-day conditions. The vegetation continuous fields (VCF) product that is based on satellite observations in 2001 is used to evaluate the fractional distributions of woody vegetation cover and bare ground. The model performance is quantified using two metrics: a square of the Pearson correlation coefficient, r2, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). On a global scale, r2 and RMSE of modeled tree cover are equal to 0.61 and 0.19, respectively, which we consider as satisfactory values. The model simulates tree cover and bare ground with r2 higher for the Northern Hemisphere (0.66) than for the Southern Hemisphere (0.48–0.50). We complement this analysis with an evaluation of the simulated land-surface albedo using the difference in net surface radiation. On a global scale, the correlation between modeled and observed albedos is high during all seasons, whereas the main disagreement occurs in spring in the high northern latitudes. This discrepancy can be attributed to a high sensitivity of the land-surface albedo to the simulated snow cover and snow-masking effect of trees. By contrast, the tropics are characterized by very high correlation and relatively low RMSE (5.4–6.5 W/m2) during all seasons. The presented approach could be applied for an evaluation of vegetation cover and land-surface albedo simulated by different ESMs.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the representation of emissions from megacities in three global anthropogenic emission inventories. Despite the many common sources of data between the inventories, and the similarities in their construction methodologies, there are some very large differences (often a factor of two) between the emissions for individual cities, even when the total global emissions are very similar. We find that the geographical distribution of the emissions within countries plays a larger role in explaining the differences between the inventories than differences in the country total emissions. We also find very large differences between the contribution of various sectors to the total emissions from each city, and relate these differences to the respective methodologies used in the inventory construction. By and large, in OECD countries megacity emissions from the global inventories are dominated by road transport, especially for CO and to a lesser degree for NO,. In non-OECD countries, notably in Asia, megacity CO emissions are dominated by residential biofuel use, while industrial emissions predominate for NO,. Non-methane hydrocarbon emissions in OECD megacities are caused by industry and traffic, whereas in non-OECD countries residential biofuel use makes significant contributions. These emission signatures often result from assumptions about the distribution of emissions according to gridded population density maps rather than according to the actual location of the emitting processes. We recommend the use of an ensemble of inventories, that the geographical distribution of emissions receives increased attention, and that local inventories be integrated into global emission inventories.

Examination of Megacities in global inventories: EDGAR, IPCC-AR4, RETRO

In OECD-countries: megacity emissions are dominated by road transport
In non-OECD-countries: megacity emissions are dominated by residential biofuel use (CO) or industrial emissions (NOx)

difference of completeness of different emission inventories:
RETRO only includes CO emissions from combustion sources (EDGAR and IPCC-AR4 includeemissions from non-combustion sources such as iron and steel sector)

RETRO: country emissions are distributed according to population density
RETRO, IPCC-AR4: No aircraft-emissions

RETRO and IPCC-AR4 show similar global totals (CO, NOx) while EDGAR is 10% higher

Industrial NOx is more important in Megacities than globally (in contrast to transport NOx)

Emission-percentages of cities are very similar in all three inventories.

All inventories are different to Gurjar et al. 2004 where transport plays a much smaller role than the domestic sector.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to improve the representation of ozone absorption in the stratosphere of the MAECHAM5 general circulation model, the spectral resolution of the shortwave radiation parameterization used in the model has been increased from 4 to 6 bands. Two 20-years simulations with the general circulation model have been performed, one with the standard and the other with the newly introduced parameterization respectively, to evaluate the temperature and dynamical changes arising from the two different representations of the shortwave radiative transfer. In the simulation with the increased spectral resolution in the radiation parameterization, a significant warming of almost the entire model domain is reported. At the summer stratopause the temperature increase is about 6K and alleviates the cold bias present in the model when the standard radiation scheme is used. These general circulation model results are consistent both with previous validation of the radiation scheme and with the offline clear-sky comparison performed in the current work with a discrete ordinate 4 stream scattering line by line radiative transfer model. The offline validation shows a substantial reduction of the daily averaged shortwave heating rate bias ( 1 - 2 K/day cooling) that occurs for the standard radiation parameterization in the upper stratosphere, present under a range of atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the 6 band shortwave radiation parameterization is considered to be better suited for the representation of the ozone absorption in the stratosphere than the 4 band parameterization. Concerning the dynamical response in the general circulation model, it is found that the reported warming at the summer stratopause induces stronger zonal mean zonal winds in the middle atmosphere. These stronger zonal mean zonal winds thereafter appear to produce a dynamical feedback that results in a dynamical warming ( cooling) of the polar winter ( summer) mesosphere, caused by an increased downward ( upward) circulation in the winter ( summer) hemisphere. In addition, the comparison of the two simulations performed with the general circulation model shows that the increase in the spectral resolution of the shortwave radiation and the associated changes in the cloud optical properties result in a warming (0.5 - 1 K) and moistening (3\% - 12\%) of the upper tropical troposphere. By comparing these modeled differences with previous works, it appears that the reported changes in the solar radiation scheme contribute to improve the model mean temperature also in the troposphere.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements obtained during the NASA Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) experiment are used in conjunction with regional modeling analysis to evaluate emission estimates for Asia. A comparison between the modeled values and the observations is one method to evaluate emissions. Based on such analysis it is concluded that the inventory performs well for the light alkanes, CO, ethyne, SO2, and NOx. Furthermore, based on model skill in predicting important photochemical species such as O-3, HCHO, OH, HO2, and HNO3, it is found that the emissions inventories are of sufficient quality to support preliminary studies of ozone production. These are important finding in light of the fact that emission estimates for many species (such as speciated NMHCs and BC) for this region have only recently been estimated and are highly uncertain. Using a classification of the measurements built upon trajectory analysis, we compare observed species distributions and ratios of species to those modeled and to ratios estimated from the emissions inventory. It is shown that this technique can reconstruct a spatial distribution of propane/benzene that looks remarkably similar to that calculated from the emissions inventory. A major discrepancy between modeled and observed behavior is found in the Yellow Sea, where modeled values are systematically underpredicted. The integrated analysis suggests that this may be related to an underestimation of emissions from the domestic sector. The emission is further tested by comparing observed and measured species ratios in identified megacity plumes. Many of the model derived ratios (e.g., BC/CO, SOx/C2H2) fall within similar to25% of those observed and all fall outside of a factor of 2.5.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Making use of the Köppen–Trewartha (K–T) climate classification, we have found that a set of nine high-resolution regional climate models (RCM) are fairly capable of reproducing the current climate in Europe. The percentage of grid-point to grid-point coincidences between climate subtypes based on the control simulations and those of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) climatology varied between 73 and 82%. The best agreement with the CRU climatology corresponds to the RCM “ensemble mean”. The K–T classification was then used to elucidate scenarios of climate change for 2071–2100 under the SRES A2 emission scenario. The percentage of land grid-points with unchanged K–T subtypes ranged from 41 to 49%, while those with a shift from the current climate subtypes towards warmer or drier ones ranged from 51 to 59%. As a first approximation, one may assume that in regions with a shift of two or more climate subtypes, ecosystems might be at risk. Excluding northern Scandinavia, such regions were projected to cover about 12% of the European land area.},

  Abstract                 = {Both decision-makers and the general public need detailed information on future climate to evaluate the risks associated with possible climate change due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Projections of future climate change already exist, but they are deficient, in terms of both the characterization of their uncertainties and their regional detail. To date, the assessment of potential impacts of climate change has generally relied on projections from simple climate models or coarse resolution coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs). The former include, at best, only a limited physical representation of the climate system. The latter are unable to resolve processes occurring at scales of less than ∼300 km. This resolution limitation precludes the simulation of realistic extreme events and the detailed spatial structure of variables like temperature and precipitation over regions characterized by heterogeneous surfaces. Typical examples of such regions are mountainous areas such as the Alps or Scandinavia or coastal zones, and areas surrounding inland seas, such as the Mediterranean and Baltic.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: An important new development within the European ENSEMBLES project has been to explore performance-based weighting of regional climate models (RCMs). Until now, although no weighting has been applied in multi-RCM analyses, one could claim that an assumption of &#x2018;equal weight&#x2019; was implicitly adopted. At the same time, different RCMs generate different results, e.g. for various types of extremes, and these results need to be combined when using the full RCM ensemble. The process of constructing, assigning and combining metrics of model performance is not straightforward. Rather, there is a considerable degree of subjectivity both in the choice of metrics and on how these may be combined into weights. We explore the applicability of combining a set of 6 specifically designed RCM performance metrics to produce one aggregated model weight with the purpose of combining climate change information from the range of RCMs used within ENSEMBLES. These metrics capture aspects of model performance in reproducing large-scale circulation patterns, meso-scale signals, daily temperature and precipitation distributions and extremes, trends and the annual cycle. We examine different aggregation procedures that generate different inter-model spreads of weights. The use of model weights is sensitive to the aggregation procedure and shows different sensitivities to the selected metrics. Generally, however, we do not find compelling evidence of an improved description of mean climate states using performance-based weights in comparison to the use of equal weights. We suggest that model weighting adds another level of uncertainty to the generation of ensemble-based climate projections, which should be suitably explored, although our results indicate that this uncertainty remains relatively small for the weighting procedures examined.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring data from the UK Automatic Urban and Rural Network are used to investigate the relationships between ambient levels of ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a function of NOx, for levels ranging from those typical of UK rural sites to those observed at polluted urban kerbside sites. Particular emphasis is placed on establishing how the level of [`]oxidant', OX (taken to be the sum of O3 and NO2) varies with the level of NOx, and therefore to gain some insight into the atmospheric sources of OX, particularly at polluted urban locations. The analyses indicate that the level of OX at a given location is made up of NOx-independent and NOx-dependent contributions. The former is effectively a regional contribution which equates to the regional background O3 level, whereas the latter is effectively a local contribution which correlates with the level of primary pollution. The local oxidant source has probable contributions from (i) direct NO2 emissions, (ii) the thermal reaction of NO with O2 at high NOx, and (iii) common-source emission of species which promote NO to NO2 conversion. The final category may include nitrous acid (HONO), which appears to be emitted directly in vehicle exhaust, and is potentially photolysed to generate HOx radicals on a short timescale throughout the year at southern UK latitudes. The analyses also show that the local oxidant source has significant site-to-site variations, and possible reasons for these variations are discussed. Relationships between OX and NOx, based on annual mean data, and fitted functions describing the relative contributions to OX made by NO2 and O3, are used to define expressions which describe the likely variation of annual mean NO2 as a function of NOx at 14 urban and suburban sites, and which can take account of possible changes in the regional background of O3.},

  Abstract                 = {Carbon monoxide (CO) is a key species for tracking pollution plumes. The Measurement Of Pollution in The Troposphere (MOPITT) mission onboard the Terra satellite has already provided 7.5 years of CO atmospheric concentration measurements around the globe. Limited sensitivity to the boundary layer is well known to be a weakness of nadir looking thermal infrared sounders. This paper investigates the possibility of using the MOPITT surface measurements to detect CO emitted by cities and urban centers. By selecting the data and averaging them over long time periods, we demonstrate that the CO pollution arising from the large cities and urban areas can be distinguished from the background transported pollution. The more favorable observations are obtained during daytime and at locations where the thermal contrast (temperature gradient) between the surface and lower atmosphere is significant.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the extent to which the sensitivity of ground-level ozone concentrations to precursor emissions varies with grid resolution in a regional air quality model. Nested grids of 36-, 12- and 4-km resolution are applied to model an air pollution episode in Georgia. A direct sensitivity analysis method is used to compute the response of ozone to emissions of its precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). All three grids predict that ozone production is limited primarily by the availability of NOx, and yield similar predictions of average ozone sensitivity to both regional and local emissions of NOx. However, in urban areas, the coarsest (36-km) resolution fails to capture the extent and magnitude of VOC sensitivity and underpredicts the nonlinearity of ozone response indicated by the finest resolution. Medium (12-km) resolution is sufficient to reproduce most features of ozone response, except for the texture of local variability. Despite the consistency of average results, discrepancies in wind fields at times lead to inconsistencies in the predicted location of ozone enhancements, especially for a power plant plume.

  Abstract                 = {The Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) has recently been developed and released to the climate community. CCSM3 is a coupled climate model with components representing the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface connected by a flux coupler. CCSM3 is designed to produce realistic simulations over a wide range of spatial resolutions, enabling inexpensive simulations lasting several millennia or detailed studies of continental-scale dynamics, variability, and climate change. This paper will show results from the configuration used for climate-change simulations with a T85 grid for the atmosphere and land and a grid with approximately 1 degrees resolution for the ocean and sea ice. The new system incorporates several significant improvements in the physical parameterizations. The enhancements in the model physics are designed to reduce or eliminate several systematic biases in the mean climate produced by previous editions of CCSM. These include new treatments of cloud processes, aerosol radiative forcing, land-atmosphere fluxes, ocean mixed layer processes, and sea ice dynamics. There are significant improvements in the sea ice thickness, polar radiation budgets, tropical sea surface temperatures, and cloud radiative effects. CCSM3 can produce stable climate simulations of millennial duration without ad hoc adjustments to the fluxes exchanged among the component models. Nonetheless, there are still systematic biases in the ocean-atmosphere fluxes in coastal regions west of continents, the spectrum of ENSO variability, the spatial distribution of precipitation in the tropical oceans, and continental precipitation and surface air temperatures. Work is under way to extend CCSM to a more accurate and comprehensive model of the earth's climate system.},

  Abstract                 = {During six aircraft flights conducted as part of the third Arctic Gas and Aerosol Sampling Program (AGASP III, March 1989), 189 air samples were collected throughout the Arctic troposphere and lower stratosphere for analysis of CO2, CH4 and CO. The mixing ratios of the three gases varied significantly both horizontally and vertically. Elevated concentrations were found in layers with high anthropogenic aerosol concentrations (Arctic Haze), The mixing ratios of CO2, CH4 and CO were highly correlated on all flights. A linear regression of CH4 vs CO2 for pooled data from all flights yielded a correlation coefficient (r(2)) of 0.88 and a slope of 13.5 ppb CH4/ppm CO2 (n = 186). For CO vs CO2 a pooled linear regression gave r(2) = 0.91 and a slope of 15.8 ppb CO/ppm CO2 (n = 182). Carbon dioxide, CH4 and CO also exhibited mean vertical gradients with slopes of 0.37, -4.4 and -4.2 ppb km(-1), respectively. Since the carbon dioxide variations observed in the Arctic atmosphere during winter are due primarily to variations in the emissions and transport of anthropogenic CO2 from Europe and Asia, the strong correlations that we have found suggest that a similar interpretation applies to CH4 and CO. Using reliable estimates of CO2 emissions for the source regions and the measured CH4/CO2 and CO/CO2 ratios, we estimate a regional European CH4 source of 47+/-6 Tg CH4 yr(-1) that may be associated with fossil fuel combustion. A similar calculation for CO results in an estimated regional CO source of 82+/- 2Tg CO yr(-1). },

  Abstract                 = {Incomplete global coverage is a potential source of bias in global temperature reconstructions if the unsampled regions are not uniformly distributed over the planet's surface. The widely used HadCRUT4 dataset covers on average about 84% of the globe over recent decades, with the unsampled regions being concentrated at the poles and over Africa. Three existing reconstructions with near-global coverage are examined, each suggesting that HadCRUT4 is subject to bias due to its treatment of unobserved regions.Two alternative approaches for reconstructing global temperatures are explored, one based on an optimal interpolation algorithm and the other a hybrid method incorporating additional information from the satellite temperature record. The methods are validated on the basis of their skill at reconstructing omitted sets of observations. Both methods provide superior results than excluding the unsampled regions, with the hybrid method showing particular skill around the regions where no observations are available.Temperature trends are compared for the hybrid global temperature reconstruction and the raw HadCRUT4 data. The widely quoted trend since 1997 in the hybrid global reconstruction is two and a half times greater than the corresponding trend in the coverage-biased HadCRUT4 data. Coverage bias causes a cool bias in recent temperatures relative to the late 1990s which increases from around 1998 to the present. Trends starting in 1997 or 1998 are particularly biased with respect to the global trend. The issue is exacerbated by the strong El Niño event of 1997-1998, which also tends to suppress trends starting during those years.},

  Abstract                 = {During Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P), there were several opportunities to perform in situ sampling coincident with overpasses of the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on board the EOS Terra satellite. This sampling consisted of in situ vertical profiles of CO by NASA's DC-8 aircraft intended to provide data useful for validating MOPITT observations of CO column. One particular profile conducted over the central North Pacific revealed a layer of pollution characterized by CO mixing ratios more than double background values. Sampling of the surrounding region by both the NASA DC-8 and P-3B aircraft showed this layer to have a considerable geographic extent, at least 25degrees longitude (similar to2500 km) and 4degrees latitude (similar to400 km). Using back trajectory analysis, this polluted layer is followed back in time and compared with four consecutive MOPITT overpasses. MOPITT observations during these four overpasses agree well with the location of the layer as inferred by the trajectories; however, the detected CO column amount increases backward in time by just over 20%. Further analysis shows that the majority of this change in detected column abundance is consistent with two factors: ( 1) changes in the thickness of the polluted layer over time (9 +/- 3%) and (2) changes in retrieved column abundance due to the altitude of the layer (7 +/- 3%). This demonstrates that there are both real and artificial sources of variability that must be understood before MOPITT observations can be quantitatively useful. An unexpected finding was the difference in the variance of MOPITT observations depending on whether observations were taken under daylight or nighttime conditions. The variance in daytime observations of the polluted layer was approximately double that for nighttime data. The results of this analysis indicate that targeted in situ sampling of large-scale pollution events can provide insight leading to more realistic interpretation of MOPITT observations. Strategies for sampling such events repeatedly during their evolution could also provide more interesting opportunities for validation.},

  Abstract                 = {An expedient method is proposed for the lateral boundary treatment of a limited-area prediction model. The method involves the relaxation of the interior flow in the vicinity of the boundary to the external fully prescribed flow. A systematic study of the method is undertaken with an (x, z), linear, primitive equation model. Analytical considerations of the method for the continuous equations demonstrate the manner in which the method consumes gravity wave energy, error and fine spatial scale potential vorticity near the lateral boundaries. Numerical experiments are also undertaken to assess the usefulness of the method. The results indicate that the method gives an adequate representation of outgoing gravity waves with and without an ambient shear flow, and also allows the substantially undistorted transmission of geostrophically balanced flow out of the interior of the limited domain.

On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the method constitutes a promising utilitarian treatment of the lateral boundaries.},

We show that in situ surface-based data sets for carbon monoxide ( CO) volume mixing ratio (VMR) indicate that the variability of CO is more accurately modeled in terms of a "lognormal'' probability distribution function (PDF) than a "VMR-normal'' PDF. The VMR-normal PDF is particularly poor at describing CO variability in unpolluted conditions. We also compare retrievals of carbon monoxide ( CO) vertical profiles based on Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) observations for 1 day using both VMR-normal and lognormal statistical models. Use of the lognormal model improves retrieval convergence and yields fewer profiles with unphysically small VMR values. Generally, these results highlight the importance of properly representing the variability of trace gas concentrations in optimal estimation-based retrieval algorithms.},

lognormal-retrieval has many advantages and is closer to reality than normal retrieval.

Constraint values (positive) are better represented by log-normal-distribution

A priori has big influences on retrieval.

Several effects leads to differences between VMR and log(VMR) retrieval:
1) A priori effect
2) PDF Shape Effect
log(VMR): shift to higher CO values in very clean and very polluted regions
no big difference in moderate CO concentration regions
look at the shape of the distribution function!!
3) Convergence Effect:
unphysically small values (due to the Gauss-shape) leads to a significant fraction of rejected retrievals
(~10%) in clean regions.
This leads to more rejections of small values in the VMS-retrieval.
Therefore the VMS-retrieval tends to higher values.
4) DFS (Degrees of Freedom for Signal)
Increasing DFS means less constraint to a priori values and more sensitive to real values.

Less unphysical values with log (VMR)},

Calculated averaging kernels for operational MOPITT CO profiles indicate the capability of independently retrieving mid- and upper-tropospheric CO. The information content in MOPITT retrievals is objectively quantified through calculation of the Degrees of Freedom for Signal (DFS), which indicates the number of independent pieces of information in the retrieved profile. DFS values larger than 1 ( indicating some amount of profile shape information) are common in tropical and midlatitude scenes. The existence of shape information in actual MOPITT retrieved profiles is also verified through ( 1) a quantitative comparison with in-situ data acquired as part of MOPITT validation and ( 2) a qualitative comparison with monthly mean rain rate ( as an index for convection) in the Tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) is a new remote sensing instrument aboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) "Terra'' satellite which exploits gas correlation radiometry principles to quantify tropospheric concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4). The MOPITT CO retrieval algorithm employs a nonlinear optimal estimation method to iteratively solve for the CO profile which is statistically most consistent with both the satellite-measured radiances and a priori information. The algorithm's theoretical basis is described in terms of the observed radiances and their weighting functions, the a priori information, and the retrieval averaging kernels. Examples of actual CO retrievals over scenes with contrasting pollution conditions are demonstrated, and interpreted in the context of the retrieval averaging kernels and a priori.},

Description of MOPITT retrieval algorithm.

 * only clear sky
 * goal: estimate the true state vector from measured radiances and the associated measurement errors.
 * surface temperature and surface radiation influence measured radiances, but are also measured by MOPITT

= retrieval =
 * fixed global a priori derived from measurements

= averaging kernels =
 * averaging kernel A = relate the retrieved to the true atmospheric state
 * Analysis of retrievals -> analysis of vertical resolution and sensitivity of retrieved profiles and the a priori influence on the retrieval
 * e.g. surface retrieval is most sensitive to 800hPa-350hPa levels!!
 * a' = Ax + (I-A)x_a

 * low surface temperature leads to upward shift of max. sensitivity
 * variability max over dry sparsely vegetated regions

= retrieval errors =
 1) random radiance errors -> reduced by averaging
 2) inadequate a priori is more likely to be a regional problem (since current a priori is specifically intended to describe global CO variability)
 3) errors due to biases in either calibrated radiances or the forward model},

As part of the validation of the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument, we present a technique for comparing operational calibrated thermal band (4.7 mum) Earth-view MOPITT radiances with corresponding values calculated using the MOPITT operational radiative transfer model. In situ carbon monoxide (CO) profiles sampled from aircraft in coordination with MOPITT overpasses serve as the foundation for MOPITT validation. Characteristics of radiance errors due to in situ sampling characteristics, CO temporal and spatial variability, and surface emissivity are discussed. Results indicate that radiance biases for most of the MOPITT thermal channel radiances are typically on the order of 1%. Observed radiance biases are largest and most variable for the pressure modulation cell difference-signal radiances, probably because of the lack of in situ data in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {Optical bandpass filters in the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite remote sensing instrument selectivity limit the throughput radiance to absorptive spectral bands associated with the satellite- observed trace gases CO and CH4. Precise specification of the spectral characteristics of these filters is required to optimize retrieval accuracy. The effects and potential causes of spectral shifts in the optical bandpass filter profiles are described. Specifically, a shift in the assumed bandpass profile produces a relative bias between the calibrated satellite radiances and the corresponding values calculated by an instrument- specific forward radiative transfer model. Conversely, it is shown that the observed bias (as identified and quantified using operational MOPITT satellite radiance data) can be used to determine the relative spectral shift between the nominal (prelaunch) filter profiles and the true operational (in orbit) profiles. Revising both the radiance calibration algorithm and the forward radiative transfer model to account for the revised filter profiles effectively eliminates the radiance biases.},

  Abstract                 = {Ten regional climate models (RCM) have been integrated with the standard forcings of the PRUDENCE experiment: IPCC-SRES A2 radiative forcing and Hadley Centre boundary conditions. The response over Europe, calculated as the difference between the 2071 2100and the 1961-1990 means can be viewed as an expected value about which various uncertainties exist. Uncertainties are measured here by variance in eight sub-European boxes. Four sources of uncertainty can be evaluated with the material provided by the PRUDENCE project. Sampling uncertainty is due to the fact that the model climate is estimated as an average over a finite number of years (30). Model uncertainty is due to the fact that the models use different techniques to discretize the equations and to represent sub-grid effects. Radiative uncertainty is due to the fact that IPCC-SRES A2 is merely one hypothesis. Some RCMs have been run with another scenario of greenhouse gas concentration (IPCC-SRES B2). Boundary uncertainty is due to the fact that the regional models have been run under the constraint of the same global model. Some RCMs have been run with other boundary forcings. The contribution of the different sources varies according to the field, the region and the season, but the role of boundary forcing is generally greater than the role of the RCM, in particular for temperature. Maps of minimum expected 2m temperature and precipitation responses for the IPCC-A2 scenario show that, despite the above mentioned uncertainties, the signal from the PRUDENCE ensemble is significant.},

  Abstract                 = {Air quality data from a one year study at an urban roadside location in Central London are reported for a large number of both organic and inorganic air pollutants. The location is 5 m from the kerbside of a moderately busy road, Exhibition Road, enclosed on each side by buildings. The pollutants measured included NO, NO2, O3, SO2, CO and CO2. together with 28 non-methane hydrocarbons, including measurements of the air toxics: benzene and 1,3-butadiene. The interpretation of the air quality data used simple statistical techniques, including principal components analysis, and air pollution models of the Gaussian plume and box model variety. A comprehensive validation of the published emission inventory estimates for London was attempted using the observed air quality data. Separate contributions from the local traffic on Exhibition Road, from the general traffic in Central London, natural gas leakage and fuel combustion have been identified. The agreement between the emission factors required to explain the observed concentrations and those in the literature was excellent for a number of air pollutants and these should be of value in environmental impact assessments. Attention was also directed to an intense wintertime pollution episode which occurred during the study period, when the concentrations of all pollutants were considerably higher than usual. Elevated nitrogen dioxide concentrations were a significant feature of this episode and the box model was used to ascertain its likely production mechanism. A relationship between the hourly mean nitrogen dioxide and NOx concentrations was defined which should have general applicability in air quality policy assessments.},

The planetary wave energy fluxes in the middle troposphere of mid- latitudes between 30 and 50 degrees N are redistributed, which induces perturbations in the zonal and meridional planetary wave trains from the tropics over the mid- latitudes into the Arctic. It is shown, that the improved parameterization of Arctic sea-ice and snow albedo can trigger changes in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillation pattern with strong implications for the European climate.},

The satellite-based method to estimate UV maps is validated for EPTOMS data against
ground measurements for 17 locations in Europe. For most ground stations the estimates for
the yeardose agree within 5%. Deviations are related to high ground albedo. A suggestion has
been made for improvement of the albedo-correction. The AMOUR2.0 UV estimate was
found to correspond better with ground measurements than the models from NASA, TEMIS
(ESA) and FMI (Finnish Meteorological Institute). The EPTOMS-UV product and the FMI
model overestimate the UV dose. The TEMIS model has a good clear-sky correspondence
with ground measurement, but overestimates UV in clouded situations.
Satellite measurements of ozone and historic chlorine level have been used to make global
estimates for future ozone levels for a collection of emission scenarios for ozone depleting
substances. Analysis of the ‘best guess’ scenario, shows that the minimum in ozone level will
be reached within 15 years from now. In 2050 the UV dose for Europe will to a large extent
have returned to the values observed in 1980 if there is no climate-change driven alteration in
cloud patterns.
Future incidence maps up to the year 2100 are estimated with the dose-effect relation
presented in an earlier study. This is done for three UV related types of skin-cancer: Basal
Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and Cutaneous Malignant
Melanoma (CMM). For a stationary population, global incidences of BCC and CMM are
expected to peak around the year 2065 and for SCC around 2040.},

Pinatubo on June 15, 1991. The eruption emitted similar to 20 Mt SO2 into the lower stratosphere. Calculations made with a radiative transfer model show that UV actinic flux in the wavelength region 290-330 nm was attenuated by similar to 12% immediately after the eruption due to direct absorption by SO2, and that it was perturbed for up to 1 year after the eruption due to scattering by sulfate aerosols. We suggest that the decreased UV flux decreased the Steady-state [OH] and led to the observed anomalously large growth rates for CH4 and CO during late-1991 and early-1992. },

The hydroxyl radical is calculated interactively using a chemical parameterization to capture chemical feedbacks. We document the inventory for fossil fuels/industry and discuss major uncertainties and the causes of differences with other inventories that give significantly lower emissions. We find that emissions hardly change from 1988 to 1997, as increases in Asia are offset by decreases elsewhere. The model reproduces the 20% decrease in CO at high northern latitudes and the 10% decrease in the North Pacific, caused primarily by the decrease in European emissions. The model compares well with observations at sites impacted by fossil fuel emissions from North America, Europe, and east Asia suggesting that the emissions from this source are reliable to 25%, and we argue that bottom-up emission estimates are likely to be too low rather than too high. The model is too low at the seasonal maximum in spring in the southern tropics, except for locations in the Atlantic Ocean. This problem may be caused by an overestimate of the frequency of tropical deep convection, a common problem in models that use assimilated meteorological data. We argue that the yield of CO from methane oxidation is near unity, contrary to some other studies, based on removal rates of intermediate species.},

  Abstract                 = {Biomass burning is an annual occurrence in the tropical Southern Hemisphere (SH) and represents a major source of regional pollution. Vegetation fires emit carbon monoxide (CO), which because of its medium lifetime is an excellent tracer of tropospheric transport. CO is also one of the few tropospheric trace gases currently observed from satellite, and this provides long-term global measurements. In this paper, we use the 5-year CO data record from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument to examine the interannual variability of the SH CO loading and show how this relates to climate conditions which determine the intensity of fire sources. The MOPITT observations show an annual austral springtime peak in the SH zonal CO loading each year with dry season biomass burning emissions in South America, southern Africa, the maritime continent, and northwestern Australia. Although fires in southern Africa and South America typically produce the greatest amount of CO, the most significant interannual variation is due to varying fire activity and emissions from the maritime continent and northern Australia. We find that this variation in turn correlates well with the El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation precipitation index. Between 2000 and 2005, emissions were greatest in late 2002, and an inverse modeling of the MOPITT data using the Model of Ozone Research in the Troposphere (MOZART) chemical transport model estimates the Southeast Asia regional fire source for the year August 2002 to September 2003 to be 52 Tg CO. Comparison of the MOPITT retrievals and NOAA surface network measurements indicate that the latter do not fully capture the interannual variability or the seasonal range of the CO zonal average concentration because of biases associated with atmospheric and geographic sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {On weekends in Los Angeles County the average atmospheric concentrations of the primary reactants, NO and reactive hydrocarbons, leading to photochemical air pollution decrease. The behavior of oxidant concentration (used as a measure of the products of the photochemical reactions) usually does not follow that of the primary pollutants. In fact, we find that for most of the year the average weekend oxidant concentration is higher than the corresponding weekday value, despite the lowered emissions. However, for areas and times of particularly high oxidant concentration, for example at inland stations during the summer months, the oxidant levels do decrease on weekends. Thus care must be taken when designing short-term oxidant control strategies, as indiscriminant application of short-term traffic decreases to random days could be counterproductive. Such strategies, however, might be useful for days and places of particularly high oxidant concentration and further research to delineate the requisite conditions for the success of such strategies is in process.},

  Abstract                 = {This article describes one of the scattering algorithms of the three-dimensional polarized radiative transfer model ARTS (Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator) which has been implemented to study for example the influence of cirrus clouds on microwave limb sounding. The model uses the DOIT (Discrete Ordinate Iterative) method to solve the vector radiative transfer equation. The implementation of a discrete ordinate method is challenging due to the spherical geometry of the model atmosphere which is required for the simulation of limb radiances. The involved numerical issues, which are grid optimization and interpolation methods, are discussed in this paper. Scattering simulations are presented for limb- and down-looking geometries, for one-dimensional and three-dimensional spherical atmospheres. They show the impact of cloud particle size, shape, and orientation on the brightness temperatures and on the polarization of microwave radiation in the atmosphere. The cloud effect is much larger for limb radiances than for nadir radiances. Particle size is a very important parameter in all simulations. The polarization signal is negligible for simulations with completely randomly oriented particles, whereas for horizontally aligned particles with random azimuthal orientation the polarization signal is significant. Moreover, the effect of particle shape is only relevant for oriented cloud particles. The simulations show that it is essential to use a three-dimensional scattering model for inhomogeneous cloud layers.},

These include in situ observations from a regular program of aircraft observations at five sites ranging from the Arctic to the tropical South Pacific Ocean. Additional in situ profiles are available from several short-term research campaigns situated over North and South America, Africa, and the North and South Pacific Oceans. These correlative measurements are a crucial component of the validation of the retrieved CO profiles and columns from MOPITT. The current validation results indicate good quantitative agreement between MOPITT and in situ profiles, with an average bias less than 20 ppbv at all levels. Comparisons with measurements that were timed to sample profiles coincident with MOPITT overpasses show much less variability in the biases than those made by various groups as part of research field experiments. The validation results vary somewhat with location, as well as a change in the bias between the Phase 1 and Phase 2 retrievals ( before and after a change in the instrument configuration due to a cooler failure). During Phase 1, a positive bias is found in the lower troposphere at cleaner locations, such as over the Pacific Ocean, with smaller biases at continental sites. However, the Phase 2 CO retrievals show a negative bias at the Pacific Ocean sites. These validation comparisons provide critical assessments of the retrievals and will be used, in conjunction with ongoing improvements to the retrieval algorithms, to further reduce the retrieval biases in future data versions.},

  Abstract                 = {Tropospheric data from a number of aircraft campaigns have been gridded onto global maps, forming "data composites" of chemical species important in ozone photochemistry. Although these are not climatologies in the sense of a long temporal average, these data summaries are useful for providing a picture of the global distributions of these species and are a start to creating observations-based climatologies. Using aircraft measurements from a number of campaigns, we have averaged observations of O-3, CO, NO, NOx, HNO3, PAN, H2O2, CH3OOH, HCHO, CH3COCH3, C2H6, and C3H8 onto a 5 degrees latitude by 5 degrees longitude horizontal grid with a 1-km vertical resolution. These maps provide information about the distributions at various altitudes, but also clearly show that direct observations of the global troposphere are still very limited. A set of regions with 10 degrees-20 degrees horizontal extent has also been chosen wherein there is sufficient data to study vertical profiles, These profiles are particularly valuable for comparison with model results, especially when a full suite of chemical species can be compared simultaneously. The O-3 and NO climatologies generated from measurements obtained during commercial aircraft flights associated with the MOZAIC and NOXAR programs are incorporated with the data composites at 10-11 km. As an example of the utility of these data composites, observations are compared to results from two global chemical transport models, MOZART and IMAGES, to help identify incorrect emission sources, incorrect strength of convection, and missing chemistry in the models. These comparisons suggest that in MOZART the NO, biomass burning emissions may be too low and convection too weak and that the transport of ozone from the stratosphere in IMAGES is too great. The ozone profiles from the data composites are compared with ozonesonde climatologies and show that in some cases the aircraft data agree with the long-term averages, but in others, such as in the western Pacific during PEM-Tropics-A, agreement is lacking. Finally, the data composites provide temporal and spatial information, which can help identify the locations and seasons where new measurements would be most valuable. All of the data composites presented here are available via the Internet (http://aoss.engin.umich.edu/SASSarchive/).},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Shipping activity has increased considerably over the last century and currently represents a significant contribution to the global emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Despite this, information about the historical development of fuel consumption and emissions is generally limited, with little data published pre-1950 and large deviations reported for estimates covering the last 3 decades. To better understand the historical development in ship emissions and the uncertainties associated with the estimates, we present fuel-based CO2 and SO2 emission inventories from 1925 up to 2002 and activity-based estimates from 1970 up to 2000. The global CO2 emissions from ships in 1925 have been estimated to 229 Tg (CO2), growing to about 634 Tg (CO2) in 2002. The corresponding SO2 emissions are about 2.5 Tg (SO2) and 8.5 Tg (SO2), respectively. Our activity-based estimates of fuel consumption from 1970 to 2000, covering all oceangoing civil ships above or equal to 100 gross tonnage (GT), are lower compared to previous activity-based studies. We have applied a more detailed model approach, which includes variation in the demand for sea transport, as well as operational and technological changes of the past. This study concludes that the main reason for the large deviations found in reported inventories is the applied number of days at sea. Moreover, our modeling indicates that the ship size and the degree of utilization of the fleet, combined with the shift to diesel engines, have been the major factors determining yearly fuel consumption. Interestingly, the model results from around 1973 suggest that the fleet growth is not necessarily followed by increased fuel consumption, as technical and operational characteristics have changed. Results from this study indicate that reported sales over the last 3 decades seems not to be significantly underreported as previous simplified activity-based studies have suggested. The results confirm our previously reported modeling estimates for year 2000. Previous activity-based studies have not considered ships less than 100 GT ( e. g., today some 1.3 million fishing vessels), and we suggest that this fleet could account for an important part of the total fuel consumption ( similar to 10%).},

  Abstract                 = {[1] In the last decade many authors have found evidence on the influence of smoke from fires on the cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning characteristics, both in the lifetime scale of individual storms and on a climatological scale. In general, the observations indicate that the peak current and percentage of positive flashes increase in thunderstorms injected with smoke, while the negative peak current decreases. This article investigates the validity of these findings in thunderstorms injected with large concentrations of smoke from fires in the Amazon region, comparing CG lightning characteristics in the dry ( polluted) and wet (clean) seasons, as well as using a new methodology, based on results of a numerical simulation model of atmospheric transport of tracers coupled to a biomass burning emission model. The results confirm the previous findings and, in addition, give a first estimation of the sensitivity of these parameters to changes in the smoke concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] The updraft and downdraft mass flux profiles generated by convective parameterizations differ significantly from each other. Most convective parameterizations are tested against temperature and relative humidity profiles from radiosondes. Chemical tracers provide important additional constraints on the vertical redistribution of mass by convective parameterizations. We compile tropical climatologies of water vapor (H2O), ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric acid (HNO3) from a variety of satellite, aircraft, and balloon-based measurement platforms. These climatologies are compared with the profiles predicted by a variant of the Emanuel convective parameterization, a two-column model of the tropical atmosphere, and by the implementations of the Relaxed Arakawa Schubert (RAS) and Zhang and McFarlane (ZM) parameterizations in a three-dimensional global forecast model. In general, the models with more pronounced convective outflow in the upper troposphere compare more favorably with observations. These models are associated with increased evaporative moistening in the middle and lower troposphere.},

  Abstract                 = {{[} 1] In order to investigate possible effects of global climate change on the near-surface concentrations of photochemical compounds in southern Germany, nested regional simulations with a coupled climate-chemistry model were carried out. The simulations with a horizontal resolution of 60 km for Europe and 20 km for central Europe were driven by meteorological boundary conditions provided by a long-term simulation of the global climate model ECHAM4. Two time slices of about 10 years were compared, one representing the 1990s and one representing the 2030s. For the region of southern Germany the simulations show an increase of the mean summer temperature by almost 2 degrees along with a decrease of cloud water and ice and a corresponding increase of the photolysis frequencies and the emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons. Under the model assumption of unchanged anthropogenic emissions this leads to an increase of the mean mixing ratios of most photooxidants. Because of the complex topography and the heterogeneous distribution of precursor emissions all parameters show pronounced regional patterns. The average daily maximum ozone concentrations in southern Germany increase for the considered scenario by nearly 10\% in the summer months. Depending on the region, the increase of the mean daily maximum ranges between 2 and 6 ppb. As a consequence, the number of days when the 8-hour mean of the ozone concentration exceeds the threshold value of 120 mu g m(-3) increases by 5 to 12 days per year.},

  Abstract                 = {A new precipitation climatology covering the European Alps is presented. The analysis covers the entire mountain range including adjacent foreland areas and exhibits a resolution of about 25 km. It is based on observations at one of the densest rain-gauge networks over complex topography world-wide, embracing more than 6600 stations from the high-resolution networks of the Alpine countries. The climatology is determined from daily analyses of bias-uncorrected, quality controlled data for the 20 year period 1971-1990. The daily precipitation fields were produced with an advanced distance-weighting scheme commonly adopted for the analysis of precipitation on a global scale. The paper describes the baseline seasonal means derived from the daily analysis fields. The results depict the mesoscale distribution of the Alpine precipitation climate, its relations to the topography, and its seasonal cycle. Gridded analysis results are also provided in digital form. The most prominent Alpine effects include the enhancement of precipitation along the Alpine foothills, and the shielding of the inner-Alpine valleys. A detailed analysis along a section across the Alps also demonstrates that a simple precipitation-height relationship does not exist on the Alpine scale, because much of the topographic signal is associated with slope and shielding rather than height effects. Although systematic biases associated with the rain-gauge measurement and the topographic clustering of the stations are not corrected for, a qualitative validation of the results, using existing national climatologies shows good agreement on the mesoscale. Furthermore a comparison is made between the present climatology and the Alpine sections of the global climatology of Legates and Willmott and the Greater European climatology from the Climate Research Unit (University of East Anglia). Results indicate that the pattern and magnitude of analysed Alpine precipitation critically depend upon the density of available observations and the analysis procedure adopted.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Energy Budget (TEB) model, a detailed urban parameterisation using a generalised canyon geometry, coupled with the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS) is used to simulate the wintertime local circulation in the megacity environment of the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo (MASP) in Brazil. Model simulations are performed using actual topography and land-use fields. Comparison with a simple urban parameterisation based on the LEAF-2 scheme is also shown. Validation is based on comparison between model simulations and observations. Sensitivity tests with TEB reveal an important interaction between the sea breeze and the MASP heat island circulation. Even though topography is known to play an important role in the MASP region’s weather, in these tests the simulations were performed without topography in order to unambiguously identify the interaction between the two local circulations. The urban heat island (UHI) forms a strong convergence zone in the centre of the city and thereby accelerates the sea-breeze front toward the centre of the city. The presence of the urban region increases the sea-breeze front propagation mean speed by about 0.32&nbsp;m&nbsp;s−1 when compared with the situation of no city. After its arrival in the urban region, the sea-breeze front stalls over the centre of the city for about 2&nbsp;h. Subsequently, the sea breeze progresses beyond the city when the heat island dissipates. Thereafter, the sea breeze propagates beyond the urban area at a decelerated rate compared to a simulation without an UHI.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the importance of including in low-resolution atmospheric models the plume rise associated with the strong buoyancy of hot gases from vegetation fires. This sub-grid transport mechanism is simulated by embedding a 1D cloud resolving model, with appropriate lower boundary conditions, in each column of a 3D host model. Remote-sensing fire products are used in combination with a land use dataset for selection of appropriate fire properties. The host model provides the environmental conditions, and the plume rise is simulated explicitly. The final height of the plume is then used in the source emission field of the host model to determine the effective injection height, and the material emitted during the flaming phase is released at this height. Model results are compared with 500 hPa AIRS carbon monoxide ( CO) data for September 2002 and with CO aircraft profiles from the SMOCC campaign, showing the huge impact on model performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The atmospheric transport of biomass burning emissions in the South American and African continents is being monitored annually using a numerical simulation of air mass motions; we use a tracer transport capability developed within RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System) coupled to an emission model. Mass conservation equations are solved for carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate material (PM2.5). Source emissions of trace gases and particles associated with biomass burning activities in tropical forest, savanna and pasture have been parameterized and introduced into the model. The sources are distributed spatially and temporally and assimilated daily using the biomass burning locations detected by remote sensing. Advection effects (at grid scale) and turbulent transport (at sub-grid scale) are provided by the RAMS parameterizations. A sub-grid transport parameterization associated with moist deep and shallow convection, not explicitly resolved by the model due to its low spatial resolution, has also been introduced. Sinks associated with the process of wet and dry removal of aerosol particles and chemical transformation of gases are parameterized and introduced in the mass conservation equation. An operational system has been implemented which produces daily 48-h numerical simulations (including 24-h forecasts) of CO and PM2.5, in addition to traditional meteorological fields. The good prediction skills of the model are demonstrated by comparisons with time series of PM2.5 measured at the surface.},

  Abstract                 = {Background

A regional-scale sensitivity study has been carried out to investigate the climatic effects of forest cover change in Europe. Applying REMO (regional climate model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology), the projected temperature and precipitation tendencies have been analysed for summer, based on the results of the A2 IPCC-SRES emission scenario simulation. For the end of the 21st century it has been studied, whether the assumed forest cover increase could reduce the effects of the greenhouse gas concentration change.
Results

Based on the simulation results, biogeophysical effects of the hypothetic potential afforestation may lead to cooler and moister conditions during summer in most parts of the temperate zone. The largest relative effects of forest cover increase can be expected in northern Germany, Poland and Ukraine, which is 15–20% of the climate change signal for temperature and more than 50% for precipitation. In northern Germany and France, potential afforestation may enhance the effects of emission change, resulting in more severe heavy precipitation events. The probability of dry days and warm temperature extremes would decrease.
Conclusions

Large contiguous forest blocks can have distinctive biogeophysical effect on the climate on regional and local scale. In certain regions of the temperate zone, climate change signal due to greenhouse gas emission can be reduced by afforestation due to the dominant evaporative cooling effect during summer. Results of this case study with a hypothetical land cover change can contribute to the assessment of the role of forests in adapting to climate change. Thus they can build an important basis of the future forest policy.},

  Abstract                 = {A global uncertainty analysis of the Regional Acid Deposition Model version 2 chemical mechanism was conducted to estimate the effect of uncertainties in rate parameters and product yields on predicted concentrations of ozone and other secondary pollutants. Uncertainties were also estimated for changes in ozone due to 25% reductions in reactive organic gases (ROG), nitrogen oxides (NOx) or both. The analyses were performed for single-day box model simulations of summertime smog episodes, with uncertainties propagated using a Latin hypercube sampling scheme. The resulting uncertainties in peak ozone concentrations range from about 20 to 50% (Â±1Ï relative to the mean). Uncertainties in predicted concentrations range from 15 to 30% for HNO3, 20 to 30% for HCHO, and 40 to 70% for peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). Except with very low concentrations, uncertainties in H2O2 range from 30 to 45%. For the cases studied the choice between ROG or NOx reductions as most effective for lowering ozone concentrations is insensitive to uncertainties in chemical parameters. Product concentrations are most strongly affected by uncertainties in rate parameters for PAN chemistry, HNO3 formation, aromatics oxidation, the reaction of HO2 + NO, and photolysis of HCHO, NO2, and O3, and uncertainties in peroxy radical yields from aromatics and olefins oxidation.},

  Abstract                 = {Model uncertainty is a major issue concerning regional-scale air quality simulation. One major source of uncertainty in regional Eulerian models is due to sub-grid-scale (SGS) effects related to anthropogenic emissions. Regional models typically have horizontal grid resolution ([Delta]) of 20-80 km. Since NOx chemistry in plumes is nonlinear and often diffusion-limited, the sudden dilution of plumes over regional grid dimensions, as in current models, can lead to a fundamental distortion of their chemistry, resulting in over-production of ozone, peroxides, sulfates and nitrates in the source region, and a related over-depletion of NOx. The corresponding model uncertainty over the whole regional domain remains unquantified. In this paper, we use high-resolution information from urban and regional emission inventories and plume field studies to examine SGS features of the emissions of anthropogenic NOx and VOC (volatile organic compounds), and of their mesoscale dispersion and chemistry. Such examination provides useful insight into some of the main sources of SGS uncertainty, as well as guidance for reducing it. The mesoscale chemistry of power plant plumes is very diffusion-limited, being controlled by VOC entrainment from the background. The crosswind spread of large point-source plumes typically takes 4-6 h to reach 30 km in convective conditions, and at least a full diurnal cycle to reach 80 km. For [Delta] much larger than 20-30 km, regional models will not be able to capture the essence of the behavior of rural point-source plumes even with plume-in-grid treatment, or to resolve the NOx emissions from many large power plants in urban peripheries from the urban VOC emissions. Within urban areas, there is progressive improvement in the resolution of the important ratio VOC/NOx as [Delta] is decreased below 20 km. The nature of these emissions-related SGS features suggests that significant gain in regional model accuracy should result by limiting [Delta] to 20-30 km in the regional domain, by the use of finer nested gridding in metropolitan sub-domains, and by a reactive plume-in-grid treatment of major point-source emissions.},

The paper gives an overview of the model configurations, experiments related forcings, and initialization procedures and presents results for the simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that the climate feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080–2100 ranges from 1.5°C under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4°C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over this range, the patterns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly independent of the global warming. The model shows a tendency to reduce the ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a warmer climate, and hence acceleration in warming in the later years. The precipitation sensitivity can be as high as 2.5% K−1 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as 1.6% K−1, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in the experiment forced by RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also serves as a net carbon sink in all scenarios, predominantly in boreal regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can be explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is presents a concise review of regional climate modeling, from its ensuing stages in the late 1980s to the most recent developments. A tremendous progress has been achieved in improving the performance of regional climate models, which are currently used by a growing research community for a wide range of applications, from process studies to paleoclimate and future climate simulations. Basic concepts underlying the nested modeling technique, along with the current debate on outstanding issues in regional climate modeling, are discussed. Finally, perspectives of future developments in this rapidly evolving research area are briefly outlined. An extensive, reference list is provided to support the discussion.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of climate change prediction in response to anthropogenic forcings at multidecadal time scales is reviewed. This is identified as a predictability problem with characteristics of both first kind and second kind (due to the slow components of the climate system). It is argued that, because of the non-linear and stochastic aspects of the climate system and of the anthropogenic and natural forcings, climate change contains an intrinsic level of uncertainty. As a result, climate change prediction needs to be approached in a probabilistic way. This requires a characterization and quantification of the uncertainties associated with the sequence of steps involved in a climate change prediction. A review is presented of different approaches recently proposed to produce probabilistic climate change predictions. The additional difficulties found when extending the prediction from the global to the regional scale and the implications that these have on the choice of prediction strategy are finally discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The life cycle of pollutants is affected by chemical as well as meteorological factors, such as wind, temperature, precipitation, solar radiation. Therefore, climatic changes induced by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases may be expected to have significant effects on air quality. Because of the spatial variability of the pollutant emissions and climate-change signals, these effects are particularly relevant at the regional to local scales. This paper first briefly reviews modelling tools and methodologies used to study regional climate-change impacts on air quality. Patterns of regional precipitation, temperature, and sea-level changes emerging from the latest set of general circulation model projections are then discussed. Finally, the specific case of climate-change effects on summer ozone concentrations over Europe is presented to illustrate the potential impacts of climate change on pollutant amounts. It is concluded that climate change is an important factor that needs to be taken into account when designing future pollution-reduction policies.},

  Abstract                 = {Carbon monoxide (CO) is a dangerous exogenous poison and an essential endogenous neurotransmitter. This gas when inhaled has an anaesthetic effect, which is poorly understood, but which may be fatal if compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, if cardiac oxygen (O2) needs exceed myocardial oxygenation and/or if apnoea or asphyxia onsets. Although there is considerable evidence that hypoxia occurs late in CO poisoning, both the treatment of acutely poisoned people and environmental exposure limits are largely based on a hypoxic theory of toxicity. The significance of recent demonstrations of increased endogenous CO and NO production in neurons of animals exposed to exogenous CO, and of a related sequestration of leucocytes along the endothelium and subsequent diapedesis is also not fully understood, but may in part explain both acute and delayed deleterious effects of a CO exposure. Delayed brain injuries due to a CO exposure may be preventable by hyperbaric O2. However, the ideal dose of O2 in this context, if any, is unknown and other potential treatments need to be tested.},

  Abstract                 = {The TRACE A (Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry Near the Equator-Atlantic) experiment was designed to explore the atmospheric chemistry and meteorology over the tropical South Atlantic Ocean with a focus on the impact of South American and African biomass burning and continental outflow on the region. TRACE A was conducted in September/October 1992. Companion papers in this special issue show that the chemical composition of tropospheric air throughout the region is strongly impacted by biomass burning and outflow from both continents. This paper shows similar results and examines the chemical composition of air measured during NASA DC-8 aircraft ascents/descents at locations along the coast of both continents as well as at mid-Atlantic Ocean locations. Chemical composition of the air and backward trajectory calculations are used to illustrate the influences of continental outflow and how influences change with location throughout the region. Included in the examples are data which show that air along the Atlantic coast of Africa is impacted by outflow from both South America and Africa as air at the higher altitudes (e.g., 8 to 10 km) originates from South America, while lower-altitude air is from African sources. Of additional interest are data measured over the Indian Ocean near the tip of Africa which show aged air from South America being impacted by biomass burning emissions as the air passes over Africa 1 to 2 days prior to sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Interannual variation in biogenic emissions is not well quantified, especially on regional scales. We use a land surface model augmented with a short-term dynamic phenology scheme to estimate the interannual variation in the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) between 1982 and 2004. We use North American Regional Reanalysis data to drive two versions of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model (CLM) on a 0.1 degrees grid over eastern Texas. The first version is the standard CLM with prescribed leaf area index (LAI) (i.e., LAI varies seasonally but not interannually); the second version is the standard CLM augmented with a dynamic phenology scheme (CLM-DP) that allows LAI to respond to environmental variation. We calibrate CLM-DP using satellite-derived LAI as our visual constraint. When phenology is prescribed, the domain-mean ( domain-maximum) average absolute departure from the monthly mean BVOC flux is 11.7% (70.6%); when phenology is allowed to vary with environmental conditions, it is 22.4% (137.7%). The domain-mean (domain-maximum) average absolute departure from the monthly mean flux is lower during summer: using CLM-DP, it is 15.7% (35.3%); using the standard CLM, it is 7.0% (23.0%). The domain-average, mean-normalized standard deviation of the June-July-August mean BVOC flux is 0.0619 when LAI is prescribed and 0.183 when LAI varies with environmental conditions. Our results imply that interannual variation of leaf biomass density, which is primarily driven by interannual variability of precipitation, is a significant contributor to year-to-year differences in BVOC flux on a regional scale, of at least equal importance to interannual variation of temperature and shortwave radiation. Phenology-driven biogenic emission variability is most pronounced in regions with relatively low emissions: as a grid cell's mean BVOC flux decreases, the mean-normalized standard deviation of BVOC flux tends to increase. BVOC flux is most variable between years in subhumid, sparsely wooded regions where interannual variability of precipitation is relatively large.},

A classification method built upon back trajectory analysis and sensitivity runs using the Sulfur Transport and Emissions Model 2001 (STEM-2K1) regional chemical transport model are used to identify the aircraft observations that were influenced by megacity emissions. More than 30% of measurement points are classified as urban points, with a significant number of plumes found to have originated from Shanghai, Qingdao, Beijing, Taiyuan, Tianjin and Guiyang, Seoul, and Pusan. These data are then analyzed, and chemical characteristics of these megacities are compared. Emission estimates for the megacities are also presented and discussed in the context of expected similarities and differences in the chemical signals in the ambient air impacted by these cities. Comparisons of the observation-based ratios with emission-based estimates are presented and provide a means to test for the consistency of the emission estimates. The observation-based ratios are shown to be generally consistent with the emissions ratios. The megacity emissions are used in the STEM-2K1 model to study the effects of these emissions on criteria and photochemical species in the region. Over large portions of the Japan Sea, Yellow Sea, western Pacific Ocean, and the Bay of Bengal, megacity emissions contribute in excess of 10% of the near-surface ambient levels of O-3, CO, SO2, H2SO4, HCHO, and NOz. The megacity emissions are also used to study ozone levels in Asia under a scenario where all cities evolve their emissions in a manner such that they end up with the same VOC/NOx emission ratio as that for Tokyo. Monthly mean ozone levels are found to increase by at least 5%.},

In order to understand the reason behind the multi-model superiority, basic scenarios describing how the multi-model approach can improve over single-model skill are discussed. It is demonstrated that multi-model superiority is caused not only by error compensation but in particular by its greater consistency and reliability.},

CO and O-3 have been found to be positively correlated in pollution plumes containing O-3 precursors downwind of industrialized regions. However, we report that during continental transport from Asia, O-3 is not correlated with either CO or CH4, although CO and CH4 are strongly correlated. The relationship between CO and CH4 suggests common source regions. The lack of correlation between these species and O-3 probably indicates an O-3 source distinct from that of CO and CH4. While Asian pollution does not appear to be a strong candidate for causing the spring increase in O-3, transport characteristics and H2O vapor measurements are consistent with both an upper-tropospheric/stratospheric contribution and an enhancement from transport across O-3 gradients. },

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) were made in the North American Arctic during July-August 1988. The distribution of CH4 was variable in the atmospheric mixed layer (0-2 km), with concentrations determined primarily by interactions of biogenic emissions from wet tundra and turbulent mixing processes. Carbon monoxide exhibited little variation in unpolluted mixed layer environments indicating a minor role for biogenic sources and/or sinks in determining its distribution. In the free troposphere (2-6 km) both CO and CH4 were variable. Concentration gradients were most frequently associated with intrusions of upper tropospheric or stratospheric air into the midtroposphere, emissions from forest and tundra fires, and long-range transport of enhanced concentrations of these gases from unidentified sources. Summertime haze layers exhibited midtropospheric enhancements of CH4 similar to those measured in winter Arctic haze events. However, these summer pollution episodes did not exhibit positive correlations with particulate sulfate. The summer Arctic and subarctic haze events observed during the Arctic Boundary Layer Expedition (ABLE 3) were primarily a result of forest and tundra fires of natural origin. The tendency for relatively high variability of CO and CH4 at altitudes of 3-6 km indicates that ground-based monitoring will not provide an adequate assessment of the chemical composition of the Arctic troposphere to support future global change studies. },

  Abstract                 = {In this second of two companion papers, we present results from a new global three-dimensional chemical transport model, called MOZART (model for ozone and related chemical tracers). MOZART is developed in the framework of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM) and includes a detailed representation of tropospheric chemistry. The model provides the distribution of 56 chemical species at a spatial resolution of 2.8 degrees in both latitude and longitude, with 25 levels in the vertical (from the surface to level of 3 mbar) and a time step of 20 min. The meteorological information is supplied from a 2-year run of the NCAR Community Climate Model. The simulated distributions of ozone (O-3) and its precursors are evaluated by comparison with observational data. The distribution of methane, nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), and CO are generally well simulated by the model. The model evaluation in the tropics stresses the need for a better representation of biomass burning emissions in order to evaluate the budget of carbon monoxide, nitrogen species, and ozone with more accuracy in these regions. MOZART reproduces the NO observations in most parts of the troposphere. Nitric acid, however, is overestimated over the Pacific by up to a factor of 10 and over continental regions by a factor of 2-3. Discrepancies are also found in the simulation of PAN in the upper troposphere and in biomass burning regions. These results highlight shortcomings in our understanding of the nitrogen budget in the troposphere. The seasonal cycle of ozone in the troposphere is generally well reproduced by the model in comparison with ozone soundings. MOZART tends, however, to underestimate O-3 at higher latitudes, and specifically above 300 mbar. The global photochemical production and destruction of ozone in the troposphere are 3018 Tg/yr and 2511 Tg/yr, respectively (net ozone production of 507 Tg/yr). The stratospheric influx of O-3 is estimated to be 391 Tg/yr and the surface dry deposition 898 Tg/yr. The calculated global lifetime of methane is 9.9 years in the annual average.},

This maximum contrasts with ozonemixing ratios lower than20 ppbv measured at the same altitudes in equatorial regions. Analyses witha globalchemical transport model suggest that these elevated ozone values are part ofa large-scale tropospheric ozone plume extending from Africa to the western Pacific acrosstheIndian ocean. These plumes occur several months after the peak in biomassburninginfluence and during a period of high lightning activity in the SouthernHemispheretropical belt. The composition and geographical extent of these plumes aresimilar to theozone layers previously encountered during the biomass burning season in thisregion.Our model results suggest that production of nitrogen oxides from lightningstrokes sustains the NOx (= NO+NO2) levels and the ozonephotochemical productionrequired in the upper troposphere to form these persistent elevated ozonelayers emanating from biomass burning regions.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a European land-only daily high-resolution gridded data set for precipitation and minimum, maximum, and mean surface temperature for the period 1950-2006. This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.},

  Abstract                 = {A numerical method to solve the set of differential equations which describes the chemical development in polluted air is presented. The photochemical lifetimes, continuously monitored for all compounds, determine how the integrations are performed at all times. Components with lifetimes less than 10% of the time step, which is taken as 30 sec, are assumed to be in photochemical equilibrium, while compounds with photochemical lifetimes greater than 100 times the time step are computed according to Euler's method. All other components are calculated from the exponential solution of the continuity equation. The computational accuracy may be improved by iteration on components assumed to be determined by the instant values of other components. The convergence of the iteration is speeded up by ordering the short-lived compounds in a hierarchical sequence. Since computational errors connected with QSSA methods are difficult to assess, comparison with an automatic scheme is necessary. Our method has been compared with Gear's method for a range of model mixtures of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and air, thought to cover most conceivable situations of atmospheric pollution. The agreement with Gear's method is within a few percent for all components all the time, in most cases even within 1%. No accumulation of deviations occur during long-term integrations (e.g., 48 hr with day and night shiftings), and differences which appear during periods with strong concentration gradients (e.g., after sunrise) vanish when the activity has culminated. The method presented here is considerably more efficient than Gear's method, with respect to both computer time and storage.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an analysis of ground-based Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in South America from 2001 to 2007 in comparison with the satellite AOD product of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), aboard TERRA and AQUA satellites. Data of 12 observation sites were used with primary interest in AERONET sites located in or downwind of areas with high biomass burning activity and with measurements available for the full time range. Fires cause the predominant carbonaceous aerosol emission signal during the dry season in South America and are therefore a special focus of this study. Interannual and seasonal behavior of the observed AOD at different sites were investigated, showing clear differences between purely fire and urban influenced sites. An intercomparison of AERONET and MODIS AOD annual correlations revealed that neither an interannual long-term trend may be observed nor that correlations differ significantly owing to different overpass times of TERRA and AQUA. Individual anisotropic representativity areas for each AERONET site were derived by correlating daily AOD of each site for all years with available individual MODIS AOD pixels gridded to 1Â° Ã 1Â°. Results showed that for many sites a good AOD correlation (R2 > 0.5) persists for large, often strongly anisotropic, areas. The climatological areas of common regional aerosol regimes often extend over several hundreds of kilometers, sometimes far across national boundaries. As a practical application, these strongly inhomogeneous and anisotropic areas of influence are being implemented in the tropospheric aerosol data assimilation system of the Coupled Chemistry-Aerosol-Tracer Transport Model coupled to the Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (CCATT-BRAMS) at the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This new information promises an improved exploitation of local site sampling and, thus, chemical weather forecast.},

  Abstract                 = {The new Global Wildland Fire Emission Model (GWEM) has been developed on the basis of data from the European Space Agency's monthly Global Burnt Scar satellite product (GLOBSCAR) and results from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM). GWEM computes monthly emissions of more than 40 chemical compounds and aerosols from forest and savanna fires. This study focuses on an evaluation of the GLOBSCAR data set. The GWEM version presented here makes use of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover map. Emission totals for the year 2000 are 1741 Tg C, 5716 Tg CO2, 271 Tg CO, 12.52 Tg CH4, 9.09 Tg C (as nonmethane hydrocarbons), 8.08 Tg NOx (as NO), 24.30 Tg PM2.5, 15.80 Tg OC, and 1.84 Tg black carbon. These emissions are lower than other estimates found in literature. An evaluation assesses the uncertainties of the individual input data. The GLOBSCAR product yields reasonable estimates of burnt area for large wildland fires in most parts of the globe but experiences problems in some regions where small fires dominate. The seasonality derived from GLOBSCAR differs from other satellite products detecting active fires owing to the different algorithms applied. Application of the presented GWEM results in global chemistry transport modeling will require additional treatment of small deforestation fires in the tropical rain forest regions and small savanna fires, mainly in subequatorial Africa. Further improvements are expected from a more detailed description of the carbon pools and the inclusion of anthropogenic disturbances in the LPJ model.},

  Abstract                 = {Moist convection is a key aspect of the extratropical summer climate and strongly affects the delicate balance of processes that determines the surface climate in response to larger-scale forcings. Previous studies using parameterized convection have found that the feedback between soil moisture and precipitation is predominantly positive (more precipitation over wet soils) over Europe. Here this feedback is investigated for one full month (July 2006) over the Alpine region using two different model configurations. The first one employs regional climate simulations performed with the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling Model in Climate Mode (CCLM) on a grid spacing of 25 km. The second one uses the same model but integrated on a cloud-resolving grid of 2.2 km, allowing an explicit treatment of convection. Each configuration comprises one control and two sensitivity experiments. The latter start from perturbed soil moisture initial conditions.Comparison of the simulated soil moisture-precipitation feedback reveals significant differences between the two systems. The 25-km simulations sustain a strong positive feedback, while those at 2.2-km resolution are associated with a predominantly negative feedback. Thus the two systems yield not only different strengths of this key feedback but also different signs. This has important implications, with the cloud-resolving model exhibiting a shorter soil moisture memory and a smaller soil moisture&#8211;temperature feedback.Analysis shows that the different feedback signs relate to the sensitivity of the simulated convective development to the presence of a stable layer sitting on top of the planetary boundary layer. In the 2.2-km integrations, dry initial soil moisture conditions yield more vigorous thermals (owing to stronger daytime heating), which can more easily break through the stable air barrier, thereby leading to deep convection and ultimately to a negative soil moisture-precipitation feedback loop. In the 25-km integrations, deep convection is much less sensitive to the stable layer because of the design of the employed convective parameterization. The authors also show that there are considerable differences in the simulated soil moisture-precipitation feedback between low-resolution modeling frameworks using different cloud convection schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {This study explores the evolution and distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory three-dimensional global chemical transport model (GFDL GCTM). The work aims to gain an improved understanding of the global carbon monoxide budget, specifically focusing on the contribution of each of the four source terms to the seasonal variability of CO. The sum of all CO sources in the model is 2.5 Pg CO/yr (1 Pg = 10(3) Tg) including fossil fuel use (300 Tg CO /yr), biomass burning (748 Tg CO/yr), oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons (683 Tg CO/yr), and methane oxidation (760 Tg CO/yr). The main sink for CO is destruction by the hydroxyl radical, and we assume a hydroxyl distribution based on three-dimensional monthly varying fields given by Spivakovsky et al. {[}1990], but we increase this field by 15\% uniformly to agree with a methyl chloroform lifetime of 4.8 years {[}Prinn et al., 1995]. Our simulation produces a carbon monoxide field that agrees well with available measurements from the NOAA/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory global cooperative flask sampling network and from the Jungfraujoch observing station of the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research (EMPA) (93\% of seasonal-average data points agree within +/-25\%) and flight data from measurement campaigns of the NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment (79\% of regional-average data points agree within +/-25\%). For all 34 ground-based measurement sites we have calculated the percentage contribution of each CO source term to the total model-simulated distribution and examined how these contributions vary seasonally due to transport, changes in OH concentration, and seasonality of emission sources. CO from all four sources contributes to the total magnitude of CO in all regions. Seasonality, however, is usually governed by the transport and destruction by OH of CO emitted by fossil fuel and/or biomass burning. The sensitivity to the hydroxyl field varies spatially, with a 30\% increase in OH yielding decreases in CO ranging from 4-23\%, with lower sensitivities near emission regions where advection acts as a strong local sink. The lifetime of CO varies from 10 days over summer continental regions to well over a year at the winter poles, where we define lifetime as the turnover time in the troposphere due to reaction with OH.},

  Abstract                 = {A 1961–1990 mean monthly climatology for a ‘greater European’ region extending from 32°W to 66°E and from 25° to 81°N has been constructed at a resolution of 0.5°latitude by 0.5° longitude for a suite of nine surface climate variables: minimum, maximum, and mean air temperature; precipitation totals; sunshine hours; vapour pressure; wind speed; and (ground) frost day and rain day ( > 0.1 mm) frequencies. This climatology has been constructed from observed station data distributed across the region. Station frequencies range from 936 (wind speed) to 3078 (precipitation). Over 95 per cent of these data are based on observations between 1961 and 1990 and over 90 per cent were supplied by individual national meteorological agencies (NMAs) on specific request. For four variables, some standardization of the data had to be performed because different countries supplied data under different definitions. Thus cloud cover had to be converted to sunshine hours, relative humidity to vapour pressure, air frost days to ground frost days and rain days > 1 mm to rain days > 0.1 mm.The interpolation of the station data to the grid used elevation as one of the predictor variables and thus enabled three climate surfaces to be produced for each variable, reflecting the minimum, mean, and maximum elevation within each 0.5° by 0.5° cell. Subsets of stations were used for the interpolation of each variable, the selection being based on optimizing the spatial distribution, source priority and length of record. The accuracy of the various interpolations was assessed using validation sets of independent station data (i.e. those not used in the interpolation). Estimated mean absolute errors (MAE) ranged from under 4 per cent for vapour pressure to about 10 per cent for precipitation and up to 20 per cent for wind speed. The accuracy of the interpolated surfaces for minimum and maximum temperature was between 0.5°C and 0.8°C.We believe these results constitute the first climatology that has been constructed for this extensive European region at such a fine spatial resolution (0.5° by 0.5°) from relatively dense station networks, for three different elevation surfaces and for a wide range of surface climate variables, all expressed with respect to a standard 30-year period. The climatology is already being used by researchers for applications in the areas of ecosystem modelling, climate change impact assessment and climate model validation, and is available from the authors.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Airborne in situ measurements of NO, NO2,NOy, CO, CO2,O-3, J(NO2), and CN were performed in European thunderstorms during the field experiment EULINOX in July 1998. The measurements in the upper troposphere show enhanced NOx (= NO + NO2) concentrations within thunderstorms and their outflow at horizontal scales from 300 m to several 100 km. The maximum NO mixing ratio measured inside a thundercloud close to lightning (the aircraft was also hit by a small lightning strike) was 25 ppbv. A regional NOx enhancement of 0.5 ppbv over central Europe could be traced back to a thunderstorm event starting 24 hours earlier over Spain. The fractions of NOx in thunderclouds which are produced by lightning and convectively transported from the polluted boundary layer are determined by using CO2 and CO as tracers for boundary layer air. The analyses show that on average about 70% of the NOx increase measured in the anvil region was found to result from production by lightning and about 30% from NOx in the boundary layer. Thunderstorms are also strong sources of small particles. The peak CN concentrations measured within thunderstorm outflows (> 30,000 particles STP cm(-3)) were distinctly higher than in the polluted boundary layer. The amount of NOx produced per thunderstorm and NO produced per lightning flash was estimated. The results imply that the annual mean NOx budget in the upper troposphere over Europe is dominated by aircraft emissions (0.1 TgN yr(-1)) in comparison to lightning production (similar to0.03 TgN yr(-1)). On the global scale, NOx produced by lightning (mean 3 TgN yr(-1)) prevails over aircraft- produced NOx (0.6 TgN yr(-1)).},

  Abstract                 = {A synthesis of ground-based measurements and satellite information is described for estimating the amount of monthly averaged biomass burned in year 2000 with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km on a global scale. Emissions of trace gases and aerosols from open biomass burning are estimated from burned areas, fuel load maps, combustion factors, and emission factors. Burned area was quantified by using satellite data in conjunction with a fractional vegetation cover map. To account for spatial heterogeneity in the main types of vegetation within each 1-km grid cell, global fuel load maps have been developed from biomass density data sets for herbaceous and tree-covered land together with global fractional tree and vegetation cover maps. In regions with 40–60% tree cover a relationship between combustion completeness (or combustion factor) in fine fuels and tree cover based on recent field studies is implemented. In regions with <40% tree cover the combustion factor and emissions are related to global satellite-derived data for leaf area index. In regions with >60% tree cover and for coarse fuels in regions with 40–60% tree cover, average values for combustion factors and emission factors from field measurements are used. In addition to biomass burning from open vegetation fires, the emissions from biofuel burning in 2000 are estimated. Our best estimate for the global amount of burned biomass in 2000 is 5613 Tg DM yr−1, of which 2814 Tg DM yr−1 is associated with open burning and the remainder with biofuels. The total emissions are 2290 Tg C yr−1 (as CO2), 496 Tg CO yr−1, 32.2 Tg CH4 yr−1, 38.0 Tg NHMC yr−1, 11.5 Tg HCHO yr−1, 9.2 Tg CH3OH yr−1, 21.7 Tg CH3COOH yr−1, and 38.3 Tg PM2.5 yr−1. Our estimates for CO2, CO, and CH4 emissions from open biomass burning combined with estimates of those from biofuel burning are in the range of the estimates constrained by chemical transport models and measurements. Our use of spatially and temporally explicit data and these comparisons to global models support the conclusion that our source map offers improvements in the emission data sets for estimating the global effects of biomass burning.},

To address the capability of REMO to simulate realistically the water budget over the Baltic Sea reanalyses data (so-called perfect boundaries) were applied as lateral boundary conditions. The validation against observations shows that the results agree rather well. However not all components of the hydrological cycle are observed, therefore only some of them could be compared to the simulation results. A clear dependence of the annual cycle of precipitation from the horizontal resolution was found in the experiments. Until now it is still unclear which processes are responsible for this. Further research will help to identify the sensitive physical processes involved in the water budget and their interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of possible regional climate changes over Europe as simulated by 10 regional climate models within the context of PRUDENCE requires a careful investigation of possible systematic biases in the models. The purpose of this paper is to identify how the main model systematic biases vary across the different models. Two fundamental aspects of model validation are addressed here: the ability to simulate (1) the long-term (30 or 40 years) mean climate and (2) the inter-annual variability. The analysis concentrates on near-surface air temperature and precipitation over land and focuses mainly on winter and summer. In general, there is a warm bias with respect to the CRU data set in these extreme seasons and a tendency to cold biases in the transition seasons. In winter the typical spread (standard deviation) between the models is 1 K. During summer there is generally a better agreement between observed and simulated values of inter-annual variability although there is a relatively clear signal that the modeled temperature variability is larger than suggested by observations, while precipitation variability is closer to observations. The areas with warm (cold) bias in winter generally exhibit wet (dry) biases, whereas the relationship is the reverse during summer (though much less clear, coupling warm (cold) biases with dry (wet) ones). When comparing the RCMs with their driving GCM, they generally reproduce the large-scale circulation of the GCM though in some cases there are substantial differences between regional biases in surface temperature and precipitation.},

  Abstract                 = {A new regional atmospheric model was set up in a joint effort by DKRZ (Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum), DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst), GKSS (Forschungszentrum Geesthacht) at the MPI (Max-Planck-Institut fuer Meteorologie). This model, called REMO (REgional MOdel) can be used in the weather forecast mode as well as in the climate mode. It is based on the Europa-Model (EM), the main weather forecast model of the new numerical weather prediction system of the Deutscher Wetterdienst. In addition to the physical parameterizations implemented in the EM, REMO has the possibility of using the same physics as the global climate model (MPI) into which it is nested to assess the scale dependence of physical parameterizations within the same dynamical framework. This paper gives an overview over different case studies investigating the dependence of model results on simulation domain size, horizontal resolution, initial conditions and lateral boundaries especially for long term calculations. A sample of one month long integrations for an arbitrary July month, a four year long run for the Baltic Sea and its drainage basin and two summer seasons of the Indian Monsoon will be used to demonstrate the sensitivity of regional climate model results to different environments. The sensitivity studies show that it is very important to use realistic large scale driving fields at the lateral boundaries. The regional model results are strongly influenced by the driving fields. The domain size and the simulation length are also influencing the results.},

  Abstract                 = {A comparison of 8 regional atmospheric model systems was carried out for a three-month late summer/early autumn period in 1995 over the Baltic Sea and its catchment area. All models were configured on a common grid using similar surface and lateral boundary conditions, and ran in either data assimilation mode (short term forecasts plus data assimilation), forecast made (short term forecasts initialised daily with analyses) or climate mode (no re-initialisation of model interior during entire simulation period). Model results presented in this paper were generally post processed as daily averaged quantities, separate for land and sea areas when relevant. Post processed output was compared against available analyses or observations of cloud cover, precipitation, vertically integrated atmospheric specific humidity, runoff, surface radiation and near surface synoptic observations. The definition of a common grid and lateral forcing resulted in a high degree of agreement among the participating model results for most cases. Models operated in climate mode generally displayed slightly larger deviations from the observations than the data assimilation or forecast mode integration, but in all cases synoptic events were well captured. Correspondence to near surface synoptic quantities was good. Significant disagreement between model results was shown in particular for cloud cover and the radiative properties, average precipitation and runoff. Problems with choosing appropriate initial soil moisture conditions from a common initial soil moisture field resulted in a wide range of evaporation and sensible heat flux values during the first few weeks of the simulations, but better agreement was shown at later times.},

  Abstract                 = {Concentrations of O3, CO, NO, total reactive nitrogen oxides (NOy), H2O2, and HCHO were measured from September 4 to October 1, 1990, at a mountain ridge site in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. The data show evidence for a transition from NOx-limited to hydrocarbon-limited conditions for O3 production over the course of September. The transition is diagnosed by large decreases of the H2O2/(NOy-NOx) and HCHO/NOy concentration ratios, weakening of the correlation between O3 and NOy- NOx concentrations, and decrease of the slope ÎO3/Î(NOy-NOx). A high-O3 episode occurring in late September was associated with only 0.34 ppbv H2O2, indicative of hydrocarbon-limited conditions. A seasonal transition in photochemical regime over the eastern United States in September would be expected from theory; the production rate of odd hydrogen radicals decreases by a factor of 2 over the course of the month, due to decreasing UV radiation and humidity, allowing HNO3 production to become the dominant sink for odd hydrogen in the boundary layer and resulting in hydrocarbon-limited conditions for O3 production. Seasonal decline of isoprene emission can greatly accentuate the transition.},

  Abstract                 = {The chemical processing of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere leads to a variety of oxidised products, which are commonly referred to as secondary pollutants. Such pollutants are often formed on local or regional scales in the planetary boundary layer, and may have direct health impacts and/or play wider roles in global atmospheric chemistry. In the present review, a comparatively detailed description of our current understanding of the chemical mechanisms leading to the generation of secondary pollutants in the troposphere is provided, with particular emphasis on chemical processes occurring in the planetary boundary layer. Much of the review is devoted to a discussion of the gas-phase photochemical transformations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and their role in the formation of ozone (O3). The chemistry producing a variety of other oxidants and secondary pollutants (e.g., organic oxygenates; oxidised organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds), which are often formed in conjunction with O3, is also described. Some discussion of nighttime chemistry and the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in tropospheric chemistry is also given, since these are closely linked to the gas-phase photochemical processes. In many cases, the discussion of the relative importance of the various processes is illustrated by observational data, with emphasis generally placed on conditions appropriate to the UK and northwest continental Europe.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a rapid yet accurate method, the &#8220;delta-Eddington&#8221; approximation, for calculating monochromatic radiative fluxes in an absorbing-scattering atmosphere. By combining a Dirac delta function and a two-term approximation, it overcomes the poor accuracy of the Eddington approximation for highly asymmetric phase functions. The fraction of scattering into the truncated forward peak is taken proportional to the square of the phase function asymmetry factor, which distinguishes the delta-Eddington approximation from others of similar nature. Comparisons of delta-Eddington albedos, transnmissivities and absorptivities with more exact calculations reveal typical differences of 0&#8211;0.022 and maximum differences of 0.15 over wide ranges of optical depth, sun angle, surface albedo, single-scattering albedo and phase function asymmetry. Delta-Eddington fluxes are in error, on the average, by no more than 0.5&#37;0, and at the maximum by no more than 2&#37; of the incident flux. This computationally fast and accurate approximation is potentially of utility in applications such as general circulation and climate modelling.},

  Abstract                 = {Important feedback processes are calculated to occur by changing the direct emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), affecting the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere. As a policy measure to reduce the atmospheric loading of CH4, a 50 % reduction in the industrial emissions to 250 Tg-CO/yr would cause an increase by about 3.5% in OH concentrations leading to enhanced photochemical loss of CH4. The photochemical production of CO, although quite uncertain, may account for 40-50% of the total CO source. According to three-dimensional global model calculations, CH4 oxidation produces 700 Tg-CO/yr. Photochemical production of CO from the oxidation of naturally emitted NMHC is calculated to be equal to about 450 Tg-CO/yr, close to one third of the total photochemical source of CO. Anthropogenic NMHC oxidation forms 110 Tg-CO/yr.},

  Abstract                 = {Mechanisms through which atmospheric aerosols affect cloud microphysics, dynamics and precipitation are
investigated using a spectral microphysics two-dimensional cloud model. A significant effect of aerosols on cloud
microphysics and dynamics has been found. Maritime aerosols lead to a rapid formation of raindrops that fall
down through cloud updraughts increasing the loading in the lower part of a cloud. This is, supposedly, one of
the reasons for comparatively low updraughts in maritime convective clouds. An increase in the concentration of
small cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) leads to the formation of a large number of small droplets with a low
collision rate, resulting in a time delay of raindrop formation. Such a delay prevents a decrease in the vertical
velocity caused by the falling raindrops and thus increases the duration of the diffusion droplet growth stage,
increasing latent heat release by condensation. The additional water that rises to the freezing level increases latent
heat release by freezing. As a result, clouds developing in continental-type aerosol tend to have larger vertical
velocities and to attain higher levels.
The results show that a decrease in precipitation efficiency of single cumulus clouds arising in microphysically
continental air is attributable to a greater loss of the precipitating mass due to a greater sublimation
of ice and evaporation of drops while they are falling from higher levels through a deep layer of dry air outside
cloud updraughts. By affecting precipitation, atmospheric aerosols influence the net heating of the atmosphere.
Simulations show that aerosols also change the vertical distribution of latent heat release, increasing the level of
the heating peak.
Clouds arising under continental aerosol conditions produce as a rule stronger downdraughts and stronger
convergence in the boundary layer. Being triggered by larger dynamical forcing, secondary clouds arising in
microphysically continental air are stronger and can, according to the results of simulations, form a squall
line. The squall line formation was simulated both under maritime (GATE-74) and continental (PRE-STORM)
thermodynamic conditions. In the maritime aerosol cases, clouds developing under similar thermodynamic
conditions do not produce strong downdraughts and do not lead to squall line formation.
Thus, the ‘aerosol effect’ on precipitation can be understood only in combination with the ‘dynamical effect’
of aerosols. Simulations allow us to suggest that aerosols, which decrease the precipitation efficiency of most
single clouds, can contribute to the formation of very intensive convective clouds and thunderstorms (e.g. squall
lines, etc.) accompanied by very high precipitation rates. Affecting precipitation, net atmospheric heating and its
vertical distribution, as well as cloud depth and cloud coverage, atmospheric aerosols (including anthropogenic
ones) influence atmospheric motions and radiation balance at different scales, from convective to, possibly, global
ones.},

  Abstract                 = {The Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 3 (MOZART-3), which represents the chemical and physical processes from the troposphere through the lower mesosphere, was used to evaluate the representation of long- lived tracers and ozone using three different meteorological fields. The meteorological fields are based on (1) the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 1b (WACCM1b), (2) the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational analysis, and (3) a new reanalysis for year 2000 from ECMWF called EXP471. Model-derived tracers (methane, water vapor, and total inorganic nitrogen) and ozone are compared to data climatologies from satellites. Model mean age of air was also derived and compared to in situ CO2 and SF6 data. A detailed analysis of the chemical fields simulated by MOZART-3 shows that even though the general features characterizing the three dynamical sets are rather similar, slight differences in winds and temperature can produce substantial differences in the calculated distributions of chemical tracers. The MOZART-3 simulations that use meteorological fields from WACCM1b and ECMWF EXP471 represented best the distribution of long-lived tracers and mean age of air in the stratosphere. There was a significant improvement using the ECMWF EXP471 reanalysis data product over the ECMWF operational data product. The effect of the quasi- biennial oscillation circulation on long- lived tracers and ozone is examined.},

  Abstract                 = {A transient climate scenario experiment of the regional climate model COSMO-CLM is analyzed to assess the elevation dependency of 21st century European climate change. A focus is put on near-surface conditions. Model evaluation reveals that COSMO-CLM is able to approximately reproduce the observed altitudinal variation of 2 m temperature and precipitation in most regions and most seasons. The analysis of climate change signals suggests that 21st century climate change might considerably depend on elevation. Over most parts of Europe and in most seasons, near-surface warming significantly increases with elevation. This is consistent with the simulated changes of the free-tropospheric air temperature, but can only be fully explained by taking into account regional-scale processes involving the land surface. In winter and spring, the anomalous high-elevation warming is typically connected to a decrease in the number of snow days and the snow-albedo feedback. Further factors are changes in cloud cover and soil moisture and the proximity of low-elevation regions to the sea. The amplified warming at high elevations becomes apparent during the first half of the 21st century and results in a general decrease of near-surface lapse rates. It does not imply an early detection potential of large-scale temperature changes. For precipitation, only few consistent signals arise. In many regions precipitation changes show a pronounced elevation dependency but the details strongly depend on the season and the region under consideration. There is a tendency towards a larger relative decrease of summer precipitation at low elevations, but there are exceptions to this as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study presents the possible regional climate change over South Asia with a focus over India as simulated by three very high resolution regional climate models (RCMs). One of the most striking results is a robust increase in monsoon precipitation by the end of the 21st century but regional differences in strength. First the ability of \{RCMs\} to simulate the monsoon climate is analyzed. For this purpose all three \{RCMs\} are forced with \{ECMWF\} reanalysis data for the period 1989–2008 at a horizontal resolution of ~&#xa0;25&#xa0;km. The results are compared against independent observations. In order to simulate future climate the models are driven by lateral boundary conditions from two global climate models (GCMs: ECHAM5-MPIOM and HadCM3) using the \{SRES\} \{A1B\} scenario, except for one RCM, which only used data from one GCM. The results are presented for the full transient simulation period 1970–2099 and also for several time slices. The analysis concentrates on precipitation and temperature over land. All models show a clear signal of gradually wide-spread warming throughout the 21st century. The ensemble-mean warming over India is 1.5&#xa0;°C at the end of 2050, whereas it is 3.9&#xa0;°C at the end of century with respect to 1970–1999. The pattern of projected precipitation changes shows considerable spatial variability, with an increase in precipitation over the peninsular of India and coastal areas and, either no change or decrease further inland. From the analysis of a larger ensemble of global climate models using the \{A1B\} scenario a wide spread warming (~&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;°C) and an overall increase (~&#xa0;8.5%) in mean monsoon precipitation by the end of the 21st century is very likely. The influence of the driving \{GCM\} on the projected precipitation change simulated with each \{RCM\} is as strong as the variability among the \{RCMs\} driven with one.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a detailed statistical analysis of one year (September 2003 to August 2004) of global Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) carbon monoxide (CO) total column retrievals from the Iterative Maximum Likelihood Method (IMLM) algorithm, version 6.3. SCIAMACHY provides the first solar reflectance measurements of CO and is uniquely sensitive down to the boundary layer. SCIAMACHY measurements and chemistry transport model (CTM) results are compared and jointly evaluated. Significant improvements in agreement occur, especially close to biomass burning emission regions, when the new Global Fire Emissions Database version 2 (GFEDv2) is used with the CTM. Globally, the seasonal variation of the model is very similar to that of the SCIAMACHY measurements. For certain locations, significant differences were found, which are likely related to modeling errors due to CO emission uncertainties. Statistical analysis shows that differences between single SCIAMACHY CO total column measurements and corresponding model results are primarily explained by random instrument noise errors. This strongly suggests that the random instrument noise errors are a good diagnostic for the precision of the measurements. The analysis also indicates that noise in single SCIAMACHY CO measurements is generally greater than actual variations in total columns. It is thus required to average SCIAMACHY data over larger temporal and spatial scales to obtain valuable information. Analyses of monthly averaged SCIAMACHY measurements over 3 degrees x 2 degrees geographical regions indicates that they are of sufficient accuracy to reveal valuable information about spatial and temporal variations in CO columns and provide an important tool for model validation. A large spatial and temporal variation in instrument noise errors exists which shows a close correspondence with the spatial distribution of surface albedo and cloud cover. This large spatial variability is important for the use of monthly and annual mean SCIAMACHY CO total column measurements. The smallest instrument noise errors of monthly mean 3 degrees x 2 degrees SCIAMACHY CO total columns measurements are 0.01 x 10(18) molecules cm 2 for high surface albedo areas over the Sahara. Errors in SCIAMACHY CO total column retrievals due to errors other than instrument noise, like cloud cover, calibration, retrieval uncertainties and averaging kernels are estimated to be about 0.05-0.1 x 10(18) molecules/ cm 2 in total. The bias found between model and observations is around 0.05-0.1 10(18) molecules/ cm 2 (or about 5%) which also includes model errors. This thus provides a best estimate of the currently achievable measurement accuracy for SCIAMACHY CO monthly mean averages.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of different assumptions concerning the source magnitude as well as the vertical placement of lightning-produced nitrogen oxides is studied using the global chemistry transport model MATCH-MPIC. The responses of NOx, O3, OH, HNO3 and peroxyacetyl-nitrate (PAN) are investigated. A marked sensitivity to both parameters is found. NOx burdens globally can be enhanced by up to 100% depending on the vertical placement and source magnitude strength. In all cases, the largest enhancements occur in the tropical upper troposphere, where lifetimes of most trace gases are longer and where they thus become more susceptible to long-range transport by large-scale circulation patterns. Comparison with observations indicate that 0 and 20 Tg(N)/yr production rates of NOx from lightning are too low and too high, respectively. However, no single intermediate production rate or vertical distribution can be singled out as best fitting the observations, due to the large scatter in the datasets. This underscores the need for further measurement campaigns in key regions, such as the tropical continents.},

Most enhancement takes place in the tropical upper troposphere, between 40°N and 40°S -> wide range transport
Despite releasing 20% in the lower 2km (PICK5) the enhancement above the continental landmasses is relatively
small. This is due to the competition between ltNOx and other surface sources,
such as soil, biomass burning, urban and industrial fossil fuel burning emissions.

Interestingly:
NOx DECREASE in the extratropical troposphere with an INCREASE in ltNOx

All cases show enhancement of OH of 10% in the lowest model level in the tropics.

  Abstract                 = {Simultaneous surface level measurements of O-3, CO, methane, and light nonmethane hydrocarbons ( NMHCs) were made over the Bay of Bengal during a cruise campaign between 19 February and 28 February 2003. The mixing ratios of O3, CO, methane, ethane and acetylene were observed in the ranges of 20-52 ppbv, 126-293 ppbv, 1.65-1.85 ppmv, 622-2088 pptv and 134-1388 pptv, respectively, during the campaign period. Ratios of some measured trace gases have been used to estimate the level of photochemical processes and transport times of air parcels. Three types of air masses have been identified on the basis of source regions and transport pathways. The study region is frequently affected by transport of pollutants from the nearby continental emission sources, but the strongest pollution event during this period was due to long-range transport from extratropical Northern Hemisphere. These higher mixing ratios of trace gases are due to faster transport of air parcels from the source regions via free troposphere. On the basis of C2H2/CO ratio, it is also observed that this pollution plume was photochemically fresh. Latitudinal distributions of all the measured trace gases show significant north-south decreasing trends. In particular, gradients in the mixing ratios of NMHCs over the Bay of Bengal compare 2-3 times higher than those observed over the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Comparisons with previous measurements over the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean show significantly higher levels of these trace gases over the Bay of Bengal.},

  Abstract                 = {A three-dimensional regional scale atmosphere-chemistry model has been developed to contribute to an improved understanding of atmospheric photochemical processes. This on-line model determines meteorological processes directly together with tracer transport and photochemistry. Usually, off-line chemistry-transport models are applied which use archived data from a meteorological model as input information. However, a number of disadvantages result from the seperation of meteorological and photochemical modelling: only a part of the whole meteorological information is available in the sampled data sets and only in distinct time intervals. The availability of the whole meteorological information including subgrid scale dynamical motions like turbulence and moist convection at every model time step is the main advantage of the on-line procedure. In addition, on-line modelling allows to consider chemical-dynamical feedbacks which is not possible in the off-line mode. For validation and evaluation studies a 10-days simulation of a summersmog episode over Europe in July 1994 has been carried out with the first version of the on-line model. The results are compared with observations and with an off-line model simulation. The on-line model is able to reproduce measured near-surface concentrations in much better agreement than the off-line model does. The reason is an improved representation of tracer transport in convective clouds in the on-line model. It is responsible for the upward mixing of short-living precursor substances of photooxidants from the planetary boundary layer into the free troposphere, with a significant impact on photooxidants concentrations in the planetary boundary layer as well as in the free troposphere.

  Abstract                 = {Ozone throughout the troposphere is subject of significant temporal and spatial variability due to photochemical production in the planetary boundary layer and free troposphere, stratospheric intrusions, convective events and long range transport. However, high resolving observations of ozone in the troposphere are generally rare today. That is of special disadvantage for limited area models, which represent mathematically a differential equation system with an initial and boundary problem. As ozone concentrations usually increase from the earth surface to the stratosphere, a proper choice of the background ozone concentrations is necessary to reproduce or even predict the amount and distribution of ozone in a specific region of interest. In this paper the impact of background concentrations of ozone on regional scale model results is analysed during a summer smog episode over Europe. For this purpose ozone is artificially partitioned into individual categories. For each category, transport and chemical transformation is calculated separately. Initial and boundary concentrations of ozone dominate total ozone concentrations increasingly with height. But also in the planetary boundary layer they contribute with more than 30% to the total ozone changes and are therefore far from being negligible. Moderately modified assumptions of background ozone concentrations reveal an uncertainty of near surface ozone concentrations of 5-15% depending on the weather situation.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Elevated mixing ratios of ozone in the lower troposphere are a major summer time air pollution issue in Europe. Photochemical in-situ production is the most important source of ozone in the planetary boundary layer and has been studied extensively. However, the contributions of background ozone due to stratospheric intrusions, lightning nitrogen oxide followed by ozone production, convective mixing and intercontinental transport are still poorly quantified. We analyze in this paper the influence of the large-scale ozone background on near-surface ozone throughout a summer smog period in July 1994 over Europe. For this purpose a chain of global to mesoscale models is applied with a nesting procedure coupling the individual model simulations. It is found that background ozone as determined by the global model dominates the results of the higher resolution limited area models increasingly with height. But improvements of limited area model results are not only restricted to the free troposphere. Strong convective events like thunderstorms couple free tropospheric and planetary boundary layer air masses so that ozone from above is injected into the planetary boundary layer contributing an amount of 5-10 ppbv to near-surface ozone in the afternoon hours. A decrease in the same range of 5-10 ppbv in maximum near-surface ozone over Central Europe is found in a model simulation where European anthropogenic emissions are reduced by 25%, an amount equal to the reported emission trends in Germany from 1994 to 2000. We conclude that intercontinental transport of pollution can obscure the results of local efforts to reduce critical exposure levels of ozone.},

The impact of vegetation fire emissions on air pollution and climate has been recognised in the late 1970s. The application of satellite data for fire-related studies in the beginning of the 21th century represented a major break through in our understanding of the global importance of fires. Today the location and extent of vegetation fires, burned area and emissions released from fires are determined from satellite products even though many uncertainties persist. Numerous dedicated experimental and modeling studies contributed to improve the current knowledge of the atmospheric impact of vegetation fires. The motivation of this paper is to give an overview of vegetation fire emissions, their environmental and climate impact, and what improvements can be expected in the near future.},

  Abstract                 = {A model environment has been established, which allows an estimation of the influence of global climate change on the chemistry of the polluted atmosphere over Europe. For this purpose the regional chemistry-transport-model of the EURAD-system has been modified and made adaptable for input data from a regional climate model, which is nested in a global atmospheric circulation model. Thus, the dynamical aspect of a possible global temperature increase as well as enhanced water vapour concentrations and background concentrations of carbon monoxide and methane can be considered. By substituting the meteorological driver model the main problems arise from different vertical grids and physical parameterization Schemes. In particular, the parameterization of cloud processes has to be checked to avoid inconsistencies between the chemistry-transport-model and its meteorological driver model. As the length of a simulation period is mainly limited by the large amount of computer, time spent for the determination of chemical transformation rates, the gas-phase chemistry module has been optimized concerning computer time and numerical stability. For validation studies of the new model system two episodic simulations were investigated, one for a summer photo-oxidants period in July 1990, the other one for January 1991.

The capability of sulfate particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei, thus influencing cloud droplet number concentration, cloud albedo and the development of precipitation is referred to as indirect effect. Evidence has been presented that sulfate aerosol climate forcing is sufficiently large to reduce significantly the positive forcing by anthropogenic greenhouse gases regionally, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Until now, only coarse grid global models with rather simple chemistry modules have been applied to estimate the radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols. In this paper we would like to ascertain the short wave sulfate forcing over Europe, one of the main anthropogenic source regions. For this purpose the three-dimensional European sulfate distribution was generated by a regional climate model in combination with a complex chemistry transport model. Then a computationally efficient radiation transfer model was applied. It estimates the direct and indirect short wave forcing of sulfate aerosols on the basis of the variable sulfate mass distribution and meteorological input data. For comparison coarse grid global model results will be shown. Regional and global model results are comparable concerning the distribution and amount of sulfate burden and radiative forcing over Europe. Hence, for the estimation of the European budgets, the global model produces sufficiently precise information. As expected, the advantage of the higher resolution regional model is to show smaller scale phenomena, which cannot be resolved by the global model. Different predictions of the amount of clouds by the regional and global model modify the forcing significantly, emphazising the role of clouds in estimating the direct (and, of course, the indirect) short wave forcing of sulfate aerosols. It is further interesting to note that in the global model results about 30% of the sulfate burden and its short wave radiative forcing over Europe, one of the main anthropogenic source regions, is caused by sulfate from natural sources (DMS and volcanoes). Thus, the long-range transport of primary and secondary pollutants from outside the regional model domain contributes significantly to the limited area model's atmospheric load. Therefore, the initial and boundary chemical composition of the atmosphere For the limited area model should be investigated in more detail in the future. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {A biogenic emissions scheme has been incorporated in the global dynamic vegetation model ORCHIDEE ( Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms) in order to calculate global biogenic emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, methanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and formic and acetic acids. Important parameters such as the leaf area index are fully determined by the global vegetation model and the influences of light extinction ( for isoprene emissions) and leaf age ( for isoprene and methanol emissions) are also taken into account. We study the interannual variability of biogenic emissions using the satellite-based climate forcing ISLSCP-II as well as relevant CO2 atmospheric levels, for the 1983 - 1995 period. Mean global emissions of 460 TgC/yr for isoprene, 117 TgC/yr for monoterpenes, 106 TgC/yr for methanol and 42 TgC/yr for acetone are predicted. The mean global emission of all biogenic compounds is 752 +/- 16 TgC/yr with extremes ranging from 717 TgC/yr in 1986 to 778 TgC/yr in 1995, that is a 8.5% increase between both. This variability differs significantly from one region to another and among the regions studied, biogenic emissions anomalies were the most variable in Europe and the least variable in Indonesia ( isoprene and monoterpenes) and North America ( methanol). Two scenarios of land use changes are considered using the 1983 climate and atmospheric CO2 conditions, to study the sensitivity of biogenic emissions to vegetation alteration, namely tropical deforestation and European afforestation. Global biogenic emissions are highly affected by tropical deforestation, with a 29% decrease in isoprene emission and a 22% increase in methanol emission. Global emissions are not significantly affected by European afforestation, but on a European scale, total biogenic VOCs emissions increase by 54%.},

  Abstract                 = {For the first time, a spatial and monthly inventory has been constructed for carbonaceous particles emitted by boreal and temperate wildfires in forests, shrublands, and grasslands, with burned area data statistics, fuel load maps, fire characteristics, and particle emission factors. The time period considered is 1960â1997, and an important year-to-year variability was observed. On average, boreal and temperate vegetation fires represent 4% of global biomass burning, but during extreme years, their contribution may reach 12%, producing 9% and 20% of black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM), respectively, emitted by worldwide fires. The North American component of the boreal forest fires (Canada and Alaska) represents 4 to 122 Gg C yr-1 of BC and 0.07 to 2.4 Tg yr-1 of POM emitted, whereas the Eurasiatic component (Russia and northern Mongolia) may vary in the 16 to 474 Gg C yr-1 range for BC and between 0.3 and 9.4 Tg yr-1 for POM, with however great uncertainty. Temperate forests in conterminous United States and Europe have a much lower contribution with an average of 11 Gg C yr-1 of BC and 0.2 Tg yr-1 of POM. Grassland fires in Mongolia represent significant BC and POM sources which may reach 62 Gg C and 0.4 Tg, respectively. Finally, an annual average of BC emissions for shrubland fires in both the Mediterranean region and California is 20 Gg C yr-1, with average POM emissions of 0.1 Tg yr-1. These source maps obtained with a high spatial resolution (lox lo) can now be added to previous ones developed for other global carbonaceous aerosol sources (fossil fuel combustion, tropical biomass burning, agricultural and domestic fires) in order to provide global maps of particulate carbon emissions. Taking into account particle injection height in relation with each type of fire, our source map is a useful tool for studying the atmospheric transport and the impact of carbonaceous aerosols in three-dimensional transport and climate models.},

In this paper, theoretical studies, investigating the causes for recent declining trends in CO, are reviewed. A variety of tools, ranging from numerical models to data analysis, have been used to further our understanding about the global distribution of CO and how its growth rate may be changing. Recent comparisons of results from chemistry-transport models (CTMs) with observations are used to illustrate how well current models perform. Regions of the atmosphere or times of year when specific features in the distribution are not well captured are highlighted. Models are also used to analyse the budget of CO. Uncertainties in the calculations are discussed. The main focus of this review is on hypotheses put forward to explain recent declining trends. These involve either changes in CO emissions or the major sink via reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). The extent to which proposed mechanisms can account for observed trends is explored.},

  Abstract                 = {Two widely used approaches for parameterizing tracer transport based on convective mass fluxes are the plume ensemble formulation (PEF) and the bulk formulation (BE). Here the behavior of these two is contrasted for the specific case in which the BF airmass fluxes are derived as a direct simplification of an explicit PEF. Relative to the PEF, the BF has a greater rate of entrainment of midtropospheric air into the parcels that reach the highest altitudes, and thus is expected to compute less efficient transport of surfacelayer tracers to the upper troposphere. In this study, this difference is quantified using a new algorithm for computing mass conserving, monotonic tracer transport for both the BF and PEE, along with a technique for decomposing a bulk mass flux profile into a set of consistent, discrete plumes for use in the PER Runs with a 3D global chemistry transport model (MATCH) show that the BE is likely to be an adequate approximation for most tracers with lifetimes of a week or longer. However, for short-lived tracers (lifetimes of a couple days or less) the BF results in significantly less efficient transport to the upper troposphere than the PEE, with differences exceeding 30% on a monthly zonal mean basis.

  Abstract                 = {Air pollution in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of south China, which is one of the four regions in China most heavily affected by haze, is found to correlate with that of Hong Kong, indicating the regional nature of the Hong Kong problem. Of the 10 territory-wide episode days occurring in Hong Kong in 2003 and 2004, 3 of them coincide with the most polluted days of the month in the PRD. On two other episode days, the most polluted days in the PRD occurred within 2 days of the Hong Kong episodes. The air pollution trends of the PRD cities and Hong Kong are found to resemble each other more under certain meteorological conditions than others, notably when a tropical storm is positioned at the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and Luzon in the Philippines, and the entire PRD, including Hong Kong, is equally affected by it, resulting in photochemical events. During this time, Hong Kong is downwind of nearly all pollution sources in the region. At other positions of the storm, the eastern part of the PRD is often affected more significantly. In winter episodic conditions, which occur when weak anticyclones prevail over south China, local meteorological factors, namely, inversions and sea-breeze convergences, are believed to contribute to the temporal difference of the pollution peaks in Hong Kong and the rest of the PRD.},

The edited data base contains 24,635 spatially independent terrestrial station records and 2223 oceanic grid-point records. A procedure for correcting gauge-induced biases is presented and used to remove systematic errors caused by wind, wetting on the interior walls of the gauge, and evaporation from the gauge. These ‘corrected’ monthly precipitation observations were then interpolated to a 0·5° of latitude by 0·5° of longitude grid using a spherically based interpolation procedure. Bias-corrected spatial distributions of the annual mean and intraannual variance are presented along with a harmonic decomposition of the intra-annual variance.},

January 2003 a massive inflow of highly saline, cold and extremely
oxygen-rich water from the North Sea was recorded at Darss Sill. This
event is considered to be the most important inflow since 1993. A
coupled model system for the Baltic Sea region, called BALTIMOS, was
developed in the frame of DEKLIM/BALTEX by linking existing model
components for the atmosphere (model REMO), for the ocean including sea
ice (model BSIOM), for the hydrology (model LARSIM) as well as for
lakes. The model system consists of high resolution model components:
1/6{\deg} (\~{}18 km) with 20 vertical levels; ocean-ice 5 km with 60
vertical levels, hydrology 1/6{\deg}. The model domain covers the whole
drainage basin of the Baltic Sea as well as major parts of Europe. The
exceptional inflow events have been simulated successfully with
BALTIMOS. The simulation was initialized at 1st of February 2002 and the
model has been run until October 2003. This period includes the
exceptional warm water inflow in autumn 2002 and the major Baltic inflow
in January 2003. Different inflow characteristics are presented and
discussed. The simulated volume transport for the major inflow in
January 2003 amounts to about 250 km$^{3}$, half of which was of
salinity 17 PSU which corresponds to a salt transport of 2.7 {\times}
10$^{12}$ kg.

  Abstract                 = {The climatological structure in the upper-tropospheric summertime circulation over South America is diagnosed using a GCM (with and without South American topography), a linear model, and observational data. Emphasis is placed on understanding the origin of observed features such as the Bolivian high and the accompanying ''Nordeste low'' to the east. Results from the linear model indicate that these two features are generated in response to precipitation over the Amazon basin, central Andes, and South Atlantic convergence zone, with African precipitation also playing a crucial role in the formation of the Nordeste low. The direct mechanical and sensible beating effects of the Andes are minimal, acting only to induce a weak lee trough in midlatitudes and a shallow monsoonal circulation over the central Andes. In the GCM, the effects of the Andes include a strengthening of the Bolivian high and northward shift of the Nordeste low, primarily through changes in the precipitation field. The position of the Bolivian high is primarily determined by Amazonian precipitation and is little affected by the removal of the Andes. Strong subsidence to the west of the high is found to be important for the maintenance of the high's warm core, while large-scale convective overshooting to the east is responsible for a layer of cold air above the high.},

The workshop was organized into five sessions with presentations and discussion to address issues related to the regional climate problem, global climate modeling, statistical and dynamical downscaling, data and model diagnostics and validation, and downscaling applications. Sixty-eight invited participants attended the workshop from the U.S. and international research community. This report summarizes the presentations and discussion of the workshop and highlights the recommendations derived from the meeting. Important general recommendations include the following: 1) coordinated end-to-end prediction using integrated or linked global models, downscaling techniques, and process models should be developed to test the whole approach of impact assessment; 2) seasonal prediction experiments, especially in the context of applications of seasonal forecasts, should be encouraged as a useful framework for assessing added value of downscaling; and 3) all downscaling techniques, discussed at the workshop and shown to be valid, should be nurtured with continued research.},

We use a tool for the analysis of medical images to warp the precipitation climatologies of 14 General Circulation Models (GCMs) closer to a reanalysis of observations, rather than adjusting intensities locally as in conventional bias correction techniques. These warps are then applied to the same GCMs' simulated changes in mean climate under a CO2 quadrupling experiment. We find that the warping process not only makes GCMs' historical climatologies more closely resemble reanalysis but also reduces the disagreement between the models' response to this external forcing. Developing a tool that is tailored for the specific requirements of climate fields may provide further improvement, particularly in combination with local bias correction techniques.},

Linear correlations reveal strong relationships, but rainfall patterns are of regional scale. Areas of rainfall exhibiting strong relationships with SST are confined to the equatorial region of the Brazilian Amazon. The best relationships are found either during the season of transition between wet and dry regimes, or entirely within the dry season. It is hypothesized, and results are shown in support, that during the transition seasons, an important contributor to the SST control on seasonal totals is its influence on the timing on the rainy season onset or end. That influence appears to be stronger than the SST influence on the rainy season rain rate.},

The vertical distributions of ozone in sea breeze air masses and the characteristics of sea breezes are investigated using tethered ozonesondes and meteorological radiosondes, respectively, at a measurement site near the northern coast of Taiwan during 24 - 30 August 2003. The investigations reveal that, initially, sea breeze air masses are stable with relatively high concentrations of ozone distributed in the upper portions of the air masses. Elevated ozone layers with concentrations of 60 - 100 ppb were frequently observed at 500 - 1600 m. The growth of a thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL) inland that can bring ozone-rich air aloft in a sea breeze air mass into the growing TIBL subsequently increases the surface ozone concentrations farther inland. Accordingly, the surface ozone concentrations increase with distance inland, regardless of the photochemical production of ozone inland. A new conceptual model was presented to depict this pollution feature. According to a simple Lagrangian analysis, ozone-rich sea breeze air masses under the observed conditions generated a difference of as much as a 30 ppb between the surface ozone concentration at a near-coast location and that at a far inland location. TIBL development at a near-coast area can protect the area from fumigation of elevated ozone layers because the depth of the TIBL is limited there, such that the ozone in the elevated ozone layers cannot be brought to the ground.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] We have examined the influence of synoptic processes on the distribution of atmospheric CO as observed by the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument. In the MOPITT data, large horizontal gradients in CO, coherent at the synoptic scale, have been observed. The concentration of CO varies rapidly by as much as 50 - 100% across distances of similar to 100 km, forming distinct boundaries in the CO distribution. These can last one to several days and span horizontal distances of 600 - 1000 km. On average, such events were observed in the MOPITT CO daily images once every 3 - 4 days over North America in spring and summer 2000. We focused on three case studies over North America in August 2000 to understand the mechanisms responsible for the large gradients in CO. Through an analysis of meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/ National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis, parcel trajectory modeling, and global three-dimensional chemical transport modeling, we found that the large horizontal gradients typically reflect the differential vertical and horizontal transport of air with different chemical signatures. In the first case, the large gradients in CO over North Dakota resulted from the lifting ahead of a cold front that transported boundary layer air enriched with CO from forest fires in Montana, combined with the descent of clean air from the Canadian Prairies behind the front. In the second case, the large gradients over northeastern Texas were produced by the convective lifting over Arkansas of air with high concentrations of CO from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds and the onshore transport of clean air from the Gulf of Mexico. In the third case, we examined an example of outflow of surface pollution from North America by a cyclone. The largest gradients in this case were observed along the boundary between the boundary layer air transported by the warm conveyor belt ahead of the cold front and the clean air transported from the Atlantic by the semipermanent high-pressure system in the central Atlantic. Our results demonstrate that MOPITT can capture the influence of synoptic processes on the horizontal and vertical distribution of CO. The large gradients in COobserved on synoptic scales represent valuable information that can be exploited to improve our understanding of atmospheric CO. In particular, these results suggest that the MOPITT observations provide a useful data set with which to address a range of issues from air quality on local/ regional scales to long-range transport of pollution on continental/global scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Aerosols affect the climate system by changing cloud characteristics in many ways. They act as cloud condensation and ice nuclei, they may inhibit freezing and they could have an influence on the hydrological cycle. While the cloud albedo enhancement (Twomey effect) of warm clouds received most attention so far and traditionally is the only indirect aerosol forcing considered in transient climate simulations, here we discuss the multitude of effects. Different approaches how the climatic implications of these aerosol effects can be estimated globally as well as improvements that are needed in global climate models in order to better represent indirect aerosol effects are discussed in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of regional scale information on the global circulation has been investigated through the development and application of the so-called "two-way nesting'' technique. The two-way nesting climate model system consists of a spectral atmospheric general circulation model and a grid point regional atmospheric model. Two simulations of 10 years each have been carried out with and without the feedback of the regional model to the global model. For the regional model domain the Maritime Continent covering the tropical area of the Indonesian islands has been selected as a key region influencing the global climate. The analysis of the global atmospheric temperature field shows a clear improvement through the regional model feedback; the systematic error with respect to re-analysis data can be reduced even in regions far away from the regional model domain.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous investigations on regional climate models’ (RCM) internal variability (IV) were limited owing to small ensembles, short simulations and small domains. The present work extends previous studies with a ten-member ensemble of 10-year simulations performed with the Canadian Regional Climate Model over a large domain covering North America. The results show that the IV has no long-term tendency but rather fluctuates in time following the synoptic situation within the domain. The IV of mean-sea-level pressure (MSLP) and screen temperature (ST) show a small annual cycle with larger values in spring, which differs from previous studies. For precipitation (PCP), the IV shows a clear annual cycle with larger values in summer, as previously reported. The 10-year climatology of the IV for MSLP and ST shows a well-defined spatial distribution with larger values in the northeast of the domain, near the outflow boundary. A comparison of the IV of MSLP and ST in summer with the transient-eddy variance reveals that the IV is close to its maximum in a small region near the outflow boundary. Same analysis for PCP in summer shows that the IV reaches its maximum in most parts of the domain, except for a small region on the western side near the inflow boundary. Finally, a comparison of the 10-year climate of each simulation of the ensemble showed that the IV may have a significant impact on the climatology of some variables.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] A set of 44 potential explanatory variables is used for statistical modeling of monthly mean total ozone values of 158 ground-based stations. A stepwise elimination process leads to zonally optimized multiple regression models, which account for approximately 78% of the variance in total ozone in the tropics, 85% south of 60 degrees S and more than 90% in the three remaining zones while only retaining six explanatory variables in the model. In all regions the dynamics appear to dominate ozone variability, which is primarily described by a proxy specifically designed to describe the effects of short-term isentropic excursions at different altitude levels and the compression/expansion of air connected to convergence/divergence. The influence of equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) is also important in all regions, indicating the significant effects of anthropogenic emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODS). In addition to the dynamics and EESC, the influence of volcanic eruptions, represented by the integrated surface area density of stratospheric aerosols ( SAD), has the largest impact on total ozone in northern regions. The results of the analysis are less clear in the Southern Hemisphere where only a few long-enough ozone time series are available.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Many numerical strategies have been specifically developed for chemistry-transport models. Since no exact solutions are available for 3-D real problems, there are only few insights to choose between alternative numerical schemes and approximations, or to estimate the performance discrepancy between two approaches. However it is possible to assess the importance of numerical approximations through the comparison of different strategies. We estimated the impact of several numerical schemes for advection, diffusion and stiff chemistry. We also addressed operator splitting with different methods and operator orders. The study is performed with a gas-phase Eulerian model from the modeling platform Polyphemus. It is applied to ozone forecasts mainly over Europe, with focus on a few key species: ozone, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and hydroxy radical. The outcome is a ranking of the most sensitive numerical choices. It stresses the prominent impact of the advection scheme and of the splitting time step.},

  Abstract                 = {A multi-model ensemble of regional climate projections for Europe is employed to investigate how the time of emergence (TOE) for seasonal sums and maxima of daily precipitation depends on spatial scale. The TOE is redefined for emergence from internal variability only; the spread of the TOE due to imperfect climate model formulation is used as a measure of uncertainty in the TOE itself. Thereby, the TOE becomes a fundamentally limiting timescale and translates into a minimum spatial scale on which robust conclusions can be drawn about precipitation trends. Thus, minimum temporal and spatial scales for adaptation planning are also given. In northern Europe, positive winter trends in mean and heavy precipitation, and in southwestern and southeastern Europe, summer trends in mean precipitation already emerge within the next few decades. However, across wide areas, especially for heavy summer precipitation, the local trend emerges only late in the 21st century or later. For precipitation averaged to larger scales, the trend, in general, emerges earlier.},

The study covers the period 1929â98. Rainfall variability and variations in circulation and sea surface temperature fields have been analysed in more detail for the period 1950â98. Negative rainfall trends were identified for the entire Amazon basin, while at the regional level there is a negative trend in northern Amazonia and positive trend in southern Amazonia. Decadal time scale variations in rainfall have been discovered, with periods of relatively drier and wetter conditions, with different behaviour in northern and southern Amazonia. Spectral analyses show decadal time scale variations in southern Amazonia, while northern Amazonia exhibits both interannual and decadal scale variations. Shifts in the rainfall regime in both sections of the Amazon basin were identified as occurring in the mid-1940s and 1970s. After 1975â76, northern Amazonia received less rainfall than before 1975. Changes in the circulation and oceanic fields after 1975 suggest an important role of the warming of the tropical central and eastern Pacific on the decreasing rainfall in northern Amazonia, due to more frequent and intense El NiÃ±o events during the relatively dry period 1975â98.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanisms of climate anomalies in the Amazon basin were explored from surface climatological and hydrological series, upper-air, and satellite observations. The paper is focused on the March-April rainy season peak in the northern portion of Amazonia. Case studies for the moderately wet year 1986 (WET), showed a relatively far-southerly location of the Atlantic near-equatorial trough, and embedded intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ); strong ascending motion and vigorous convection over the Amazon basin, contrasting with pronounced subsidence off the west coast of South America; and weak subtropical westerly jets (STWJ) in both hemispheres. In contrast, the extremely dry El Nino year 1983 (DRY), featured a more northward located ITCZ; subsidence over the Amazon basin; ascending motion and convective rainfall to the west of the Andes; and strong STWJ. In synthesis from these analyses, some major mechanisms of extreme rainfall events in northern Amazonia stand out, but only for the late austral summer, when the ITCZ in the tropical Atlantic-South American sector attains its southernmost position, as the intense summertime convection over Amazonia is an important component of the ITCZ. Thus, ascending motion over the northern part of the Amazon basin with an anomalously far-southward displaced ITCZ appears compatible with subsidence to the west of the Andes during the high phase of the Southern Oscillation (SO), which is defined by anomalously high/low pressure at Tahiti/Darwin. In contrast, ascending motion and convection over the easternmost equatorial Pacific, as is common during extreme events of the low-SO phase, require compensatory subsidence, and this may interfere with convection to the east of the Andes. However, hydrometeorological anomalies in Amazonia are not prevailingly related to the SO.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2005, large sections of southwestern Amazonia experienced one of the most intense droughts of the last hundred years. The drought severely affected human population along the main channel of the Amazon River and its western and southwestern tributaries, the Solim&#245;es (also known as the Amazon River in the other Amazon countries) and the Madeira Rivers, respectively. The river levels fell to historic low levels and navigation along these rivers had to be suspended. The drought did not affect central or eastern Amazonia, a pattern different from the El Ni&#241;o&#8211;related droughts in 1926, 1983, and 1998. The choice of rainfall data used influenced the detection of the drought. While most datasets (station or gridded data) showed negative departures from mean rainfall, one dataset exhibited above-normal rainfall in western Amazonia.The causes of the drought were not related to El Ni&#241;o but to (i) the anomalously warm tropical North Atlantic, (ii) the reduced intensity in northeast trade wind moisture transport into southern Amazonia during the peak summertime season, and (iii) the weakened upward motion over this section of Amazonia, resulting in reduced convective development and rainfall. The drought conditions were intensified during the dry season into September 2005 when humidity was lower than normal and air temperatures were 3&#176;&#8211;5&#176;C warmer than normal. Because of the extended dry season in the region, forest fires affected part of southwestern Amazonia. Rains returned in October 2005 and generated flooding after February 2006.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze a transient climate change simulation for the 21st century (1980–2100)
over a large all‐Africa domain carried out with the RegCM3 regional model driven by the
ECHAM5 global model. We focus the analysis on a comparison between the driving and
nested model runs. For present climate, the two models show temperature and
precipitation biases of similar magnitude but different spatial patterns. In particular the
bias patterns in the regional model driven by ECHAM5 are more similar to those of a
regional simulation driven by ERA Interim reanalysis fields than to the bias patterns in
the present climate simulation by ECHAM5 itself. In the transient simulation, while the
temperature changes are strongly driven by the global model, the precipitation change
patterns are more different between the global and regional models, particularly over the
West Africa and Sahel regions. A targeted analysis suggests that this is due to the
different simulation by the two models of the local response to El Niño–Southern
Oscillation forcing and of local soil moisture/precipitation feedbacks. Our results thus
indicate that local processes and internal model physics and characteristics are important
elements in determining the precipitation change signal simulated by the nested regional
model in this large domain experiment, especially over equatorial and tropical regions.
This adds an element of uncertainty that needs to be address through the use of
ensembles of regional model experiments as planned in the Coordinated Regional
Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project.},

  Abstract                 = {Ship emissions contribute substantially to atmospheric pollution over the summertime Mediterranean region, thereby modifying the radiation budget through sulfate aerosol forcing. By applying a regional atmospheric-chemistry model and a radiation model we determine the seasonal variability of secondary trace gases and aerosols, their origin and impact on climate. Summer mean sulfate aerosol column burden over the Mediterranean is 7.8 mg m(-2) and remarkably higher than the European mean of 4.7 mg m(-2). Partitioning SOx emissions into land and water sources allows to investigate their respective impact on the sulfate aerosol concentration, its total burden and direct radiative forcing. 54% of the total sulfate aerosol column burden over the Mediterranean in summer originates from ship emissions. Accordingly, they contribute over 50% to the direct radiative forcing. Running the model without ship emissions significantly reduces near surface concentration of sulfate, ozone, nitric acid, hydroxy radicals and formaldehyde. As the applied ship emission inventory is based on the year 1990 and model results tend to underestimate observed concentrations at Mediterranean locations influenced by ship emissions, we assume that increased ship emissions during the past decade contribute nowadays even stronger to secondary pollution formation and radiative forcing.

  Abstract                 = {Satellite remote sensing of air quality has evolved dramatically over the last decade. Global observations are now available for a wide range of species including aerosols, tropospheric 03, tropospheric NO2, CO, HCHO, and SO2. Capabilities for satellite remote sensing of these species in the boundary layer are reviewed for current instruments, along with physical processes affecting their accuracy and precision. Applications of satellite observations are discussed for case studies of specific events, for estimates of surface concentrations, and to improve emission inventories of trace gases and aerosols. Aerosol remote sensing at visible wavelengths exhibits high sensitivity to boundary layer concentrations. Although atmospheric scattering and surface emission of thermal radiation generally reduce instrument sensitivity to trace gases near the surface, a strong boundary layer signal in NO2 arises from its large boundary layer concentrations relative to the free troposphere. Recommendations are presented including (1) additional dedicated validation activities, especially for tropospheric NO2 and HCHO; (2) improved characterization of geophysical fields that affect remote sensing of trace gases and aerosols; (3) continued development of comprehensive assimilation and inversion capabilities to relate satellite observations to emissions and surface concentrations; (4) development of satellite instruments and algorithms to achieve higher spatial resolution to resolve urban scales, facilitate validation, and reduce cloud contamination that increases remote sensing error; and (5) support for the next generate of satellite instrumentation designed for air quality applications.

  Abstract                 = {In the present study, a three-dimensional Eulerian photochemical model was employed to estimate the impact that organic compounds have on tropospheric ozone formation in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP). In the year 2000, base case simulations were conducted in two periods: August 22–24 and March 13–15. Based on the pollutant concentrations calculated by the model, the correlation coefficient relative to observations for ozone ranged from 0.91 to 0.93 in both periods. In the simulations employed to evaluate the ozone potential of individual VOCs, as well as the sensitivity of ozone to the VOC/NO x emission ratio, the variation in anthropogenic emissions was estimated at 15% (according to tests performed previously variations of 15% were stable). Although there were significant differences between the two periods, ozone concentrations were found to be much more sensitive to VOCs than to NO x in both periods and throughout the study domain. In addition, considering their individual rates of emission from vehicles, the species/classes that were most important for ozone formation were as follows: aromatics with a kOH > 2 × 104 ppm−1 min−1; olefins with a kOH < 7 × 104 ppm−1 min−1; olefins with a kOH > 7 × 104 ppm−1 min−1; ethene; and formaldehyde, which are the principal species related to the production, transport, storage and combustion of fossil fuels.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of climate change on maize production in the semi-humid and semi-arid, agro-climatic zones III-IV of Kenya was evaluated using two General Circulation Models (GCMs): the Canadian Climate Center Model (CCCM) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), as well as the CERES-Maize model. Long-term climate data was obtained from three meteorological stations situated in eastern, central and western regions of Kenya, while maize data was obtained from six sites within the regions. The climate scenarios were projected to the year 2030. Temperature increases of 2·29 and 2·89°C are predicted by the CCCM and GFDL, respectively. Rainfall levels are predicted to remain unchanged, but there are thought to be shifts in distribution. It is predicted that the short-rains season (October–January) will experience some increased rainfall, while the long-rains season (April–July) will show a decrease. Maize yields are predicted to decrease in zone III areas, while an increase is predicted in zone IV areas. However, the predicted changes in yields are low since they all fall below 500 kg ha−1, except the Homa Bay site. Thus, to counter the adverse effects of climate change on maize production, it may be necessary to use early maturing cultivars, practice early planting, and in eastern Kenya, shift to growing maize during the short-rains season.},

  Abstract                 = {During a development stage global climate models have their properties adjusted or tuned in various ways to best match the known state of the Earth's climate system. These desired properties are observables, such as the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere, the global mean temperature, sea ice, clouds and wind fields. The tuning is typically performed by adjusting uncertain, or even non-observable, parameters related to processes not explicitly represented at the model grid resolution. The practice of climate model tuning has seen an increasing level of attention because key model properties, such as climate sensitivity, have been shown to depend on frequently used tuning parameters. Here we provide insights into how climate model tuning is practically done in the case of closing the radiation balance and adjusting the global mean temperature for the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). We demonstrate that considerable ambiguity exists in the choice of parameters, and present and compare three alternatively tuned, yet plausible configurations of the climate model. The impacts of parameter tuning on climate sensitivity was less than anticipated.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyse the air quality data measured at a green area of Buenos Aires City (Argentina) during 38 days in winter. We study the relationships between ambient concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2). The variation of the level of oxidant (OX=O3+NO2) with the NOx is obtained. It can be seen that the level of OX at a given location is made up of two contributions: one independent and another dependent on the NOx concentration. The first one can be considered as a regional contribution, equivalent to the background O3 concentration and the second one as a local contribution that depends on the level of primary pollution. Local oxidant sources may include direct NO2 emissions, the reaction of NO with O2 at high-NOx levels, and the emission of species that promote the conversion of NO to NO2. The final category of emissions may include the nitrous acid (HONO) that is emitted directly in vehicle exhaust. Finally, we present a diurnal variation of the local as well as regional contributions and the dependence of the last one on wind direction.},

  Abstract                 = {A useful application of the hydrocarbon measurements collected during the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM-West A) is as markers or indices of atmospheric processing. Traditionally, ratios of particular hydrocarbons have been interpreted as photochemical indices, since much of the effect due to atmospheric transport is assumed to cancel by using ratios. However, an ever increasing body of observatonial and theoretical evidence suggests that turbulent mixing associated with atmospheric transport influences certain hydrocarbon ratios significantly. In this study a three-dimensional mesoscale photochemical model is used to study the interaction of photochemistry and atmospheric mixing on select hydrocarbons. In terms of correlations and functional relationships between various alkanes the model results and PEM-West A hydrocarbon observations share many similar characteristics as well as explainable differences. When the three-dimensional model is applied to inert tracers, hydrocarbon ratios and other relationships exactly follow those expected by simple dilution with model-imposed ''background air,'' and the three-dimensional results for reactive hydrocarbons are quite consistent with a combined influence of photochemistry and simple dilution. Analogous to these model results, relationships between various hydrocarbons collected during the PEM-West A experiment appear to be consistent with this simplified picture of photochemistry and dilution affecting individual air masses, When hydrocarbons are chosen that have negligeble contributions to clean background air, unambiguous determinations of the relative contributions to photochemistry and dilution can be estimated from the hydrocarbon samples, Both the three-dimensional model results and the observations imply an average characteristic lifetime for dilution with background air roughly equivalent to the photochemical lifetime of butane for the western Pacific lower troposphere. Moreover, the dominance of OR as the primary photochemical oxidant downwind of anthropogenic source regions can be inferred from correlations between the highly reactive alkane ratios, By incorporating back-trajectory information within the three-dimensional model analysis, a correspondence between time and a particular hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon ratio can be determined, and the influence of atmospheric mixing or photochemistry can be quantified, Results of the three-dimensional model study are compared and applied to the PEM-West A hydrocarbon dataset, yielding a practical methodology for determining average OH concentrations and atmospheric mixing rates from the hydrocarbon measurements. Aircraft data taken below 2 km during wall flights east of Japan imply a diurnal average OH concentration of similar to 3 x 10(6) cm(-3). The characteristic time for dilution with background air is estimated to be similar to 2.5 days for the two study areas examined in this work.},

The chemical reaction dynamics component, treated within the splitting scheme, is generally highly stiff. A second-order predictor, iterated corrector technique, in combination with an asymptotic treatment of the stiff components, is found to be computationally superior for the chemical kinetics.

  Abstract                 = {The sensitivity to two different emission inventories, injection altitude and temporal variations of anthropogenic emissions in aerosol modelling is studied, using the two way nested global transport chemistry model TM5 focussing on Europe in June and December 2000. The simulations of gas and aerosol concentrations and aerosol optical depth (AOD) with the EMEP and AEROCOM emission inventories are compared with EMEP gas and aerosol surface based measurements, AERONET sun photometers retrievals and MODIS satellite data. For the aerosol precursor gases SO2 and NOx in both months the model results calculated with the EMEP inventory agree better ( overestimated by a factor 1.3 for both SO2 and NOx) with the EMEP measurements than the simulation with the AEROCOM inventory ( overestimated by a factor 2.4 and 1.9, respectively). Besides the differences in total emissions between the two inventories, an important role is also played by the vertical distribution of SO2 and NOx emissions in understanding the differences between the EMEP and AEROCOM inventories. In December NOx and SO2 from both simulations agree within 50% with observations. In June SO4= evaluated with the EMEP emission inventory agrees slightly better with surface observations than the AEROCOM simulation, whereas in December the use of both inventories results in an underestimate of SO4 with a factor 2. Nitrate aerosol measured in summer is not reliable, however in December nitrate aerosol calculations with the EMEP and AEROCOM emissions agree with 30%, and 60%, respectively with the filter measurements. Differences are caused by the total emissions and the temporal distribution of the aerosol precursor gases NOx and NH3. Despite these differences, we show that the column integrated AOD is less sensitive to the underlying emission inventories. Calculated AOD values with both emission inventories underestimate the observed AERONET AOD values by 20 - 30%, whereas a case study using MODIS data shows a high spatial agreement. Our evaluation of the role of temporal distribution of anthropogenic emissions on aerosol calculations shows that the daily and weekly temporal distributions of the emissions are only important for NOx, NH3 and aerosol nitrate. However, for all aerosol species SO4=, NH4+, POM, BC, as well as for AOD, the seasonal temporal variations used in the emission inventory are important. Our study shows the value of including at least seasonal information on anthropogenic emissions, although from a comparison with a range of measurements it is often difficult to firmly identify the superiority of specific emission inventories, since other modelling uncertainties, e. g. related to transport, aerosol removal, water uptake, and model resolution, play a dominant role.},

  Abstract                 = {An evaluation of the cloud parameterization scheme in the High-Resolution Regional Model (HRM) of the Deutscher Wetterdienst was conducted using data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). Uncertainties in the model and in the measurements were first quantified. Then, criteria for comparisons of simulated and measured data were chosen in order to identify model deficiencies. The simulated clouds were subsequently classified by their parameterization so model deficiencies could be easily attributed to a certain parameterization scheme. Following this evaluation, an overestimation of simulated mean cloud amount was identified as a deficiency of the HRM. The overestimation occurred mainly during the night and was due to an overprediction of subscale clouds at low-level emissivity heights. At medium-level emissivity heights during the day, the cloud amount is underpredicted. This leads to an underestimation of the diurnal cycle. These deficiencies were connected with the relative humidity parameterization used to characterize subscale cloudiness.},

Models were driven by reanalysis (ERA-40). The analysis has emphasized on the simulation of the precipitation over land and has provided a quantification of the biases of and scatter between the different regional simulations. Most but not all dynamical models underpredict precipitation amounts in south eastern South America during the three periods. Results suggest that models have regime dependence, performing better for some conditions than others. The models’ ensemble and the statistical technique succeed in reproducing the overall observed frequency of daily precipitation for all periods. But most models tend to underestimate the frequency of dry days and overestimate the amount of light rainfall days. The number of events with strong or heavy precipitation tends to be under simulated by the models.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of anthropogenic emissions from activities, such as fossil-fuel, biomass, and biofuel burning; transportation; and land-clearing; have a profound impact on the climate system. The impact of these activities is manifested in observed changes in temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise, melting of glaciers, air quality, health, and agriculture yields, to name a few. The obvious question to ask is the role that these different processes play in affecting climate and what action could one impose to curtail or constrain adverse human impacts on climate. Greenhouse gases have long been studied, as they play a major role in changing climate. But over the past 10-20 years, aerosols have emerged as the other big contenders in climate change studies. This review focuses on the current understanding of the effects of aerosols on climate, with an emphasis on the thermodynamical and indirect aerosol effects. We also examine available measurements that could be used to decipher the aerosol influence on climate, with an outlook on how the uncertainties in aerosol effects may impact future climate predictions and policy changes.},

  Abstract                 = {A general two-step procedure for aggregating the hundreds of reported volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into a much smaller set of lumped classes appropriate for regional airshed modeling is described. In the first step, the compounds are condensed into a manageable number of emission categories which could be adapted to a variety of molecularly-based lumped chemical mechanisms. In the second step, the emissions are further aggregated into a smaller set of VOC classes which directly correspond to those in a particular model's mechanism. The application of this procedure is illustrated by aggregating the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) anthropogenic VOC emissions inventory the U.S. first into the 32-class system, and then into the groups of model species used in the latest version of the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2.0). The importance of different VOC categories and source types on regional pollution production is explored by comparing the contributions of each of the emissions groupings, RADM model species, and major emissions sources, to total moles carbon VOC reacted in model simulations. For this particular anthropogenic inventory and chemical mechanism, it is found that over 50% of the moles carbon reacted is associated with mobile sources. Such analysis can help indicate which uncertainties in anthropogenic emissions inventories may have the greatest impact on results of regional simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {For areas in the United States not meeting the federal air quality standard for ozone, an issue of continuing controversy is the emphasis to be placed on controlling nitrogen oxides (NO x ) in addition to emissions of reactive organic gases (ROG). To assess conditions under which ROG or NO x controls would be most effective, we have analyzed predictions from four studies that represent different locations and meteorological conditions, distinct chemical inputs, e.g., with or without significant biogenic emissions, and different air quality models. A consistent association is found between the sensitivity of ozone to reductions in ROG versus NO x emissions and the simulated total reactive nitrogen (NO y ) at the time and place of peak ozone. In the studies examined, ozone was predicted to be reduced most effectively by ROG controls at locations where NO y concentrations exceeded a threshhold value falling in the range of 10 to 25 ppb, whereas NO x controls were predicted to be more effective where NO y concentrations were below that threshhold. The NO y level explains much of the difference in ozone sensitivity at different locations and provides a basis for comparison of predicted sensitivity from different models. In contrast, the morning concentration ratio of ROG to NO x that has been used in the past is a less reliable indicator of O3 sensitivity. Measurement of NO y concentrations along with ozone would assist in empirical testing of model predictions of responses to emission reductions.},

  Abstract                 = {A database of monthly climate observations from meteorological stations is constructed. The database includes six climate elements and extends over the global land surface. The database is checked for inhomogeneities in the station records using an automated method that refines previous methods by using incomplete and partially overlapping records and by detecting inhomogeneities with opposite signs in different seasons. The method includes the development of reference series using neighbouring stations. Information from different sources about a single station may be combined, even without an overlapping period, using a reference series. Thus, a longer station record may be obtained and fragmentation of records reduced. The reference series also enables 1961-90 normals to be calculated for a larger proportion of stations. The station anomalies are interpolated onto a 0.5 degrees grid covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) and combined with a published normal from 1961-90. Thus, climate grids are constructed for nine climate variables (temperature, diurnal temperature range, daily minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, wet-day frequency, frost-day frequency, vapour pressure, and cloud cover) for the period 1901-2002.

  Abstract                 = {Ground-based in situ measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and submicron sulfate aerosol (SO42-) together with carbon monoxide (CO) were conducted at an urban site in Tokyo, Japan from spring 2003 to winter 2004. The observed concentrations of SO2 were affected dominantly by anthropogenic emissions (for example, manufacturing industries) in source areas, while small fraction of the data (< 30%) was affected by large point sources of SO2 (power plant and volcano). Although emission sources of CO in Tokyo are different from those of SO2, the major emission sources of CO and SO2 are colocated, indicating that CO can be used as a tracer of anthropogenic SO2 emissions in Tokyo. The ratio of SO42-to total sulfur compounds (SOx = SO2 + SO42-) and the remaining fraction of SOx, which is derived as the ratio of the linear regression slope of the SOx-CO correlation, is used as measures for the formation of SO42-and removal of SOx, respectively. Using these parameters, the average formation efficiency of SO42-(i. e., amount of SO(4)(2-)produced per SO2 emitted from emission sources) are estimated to be 0.18 and 0.03 in the summer and winter periods, respectively. A simple box model was developed to estimate the lifetime of SOx. The lifetime of SOx for the summer period (26 h) is estimated to be about two times longer than that for the winter period (14 h). The seasonal variations of the remaining fraction of SOx, estimated formation efficiency of SO42- , and lifetime of SOx are likely due to those of the boundary layer height and photochemical activity (i. e., hydroxyl radical). These results provide useful insights into the formation and removal processes of sulfur compounds exported from an urban area.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Strong heat load has negative im-
pacts on the human health and results in higher mortality
during heat waves. In Europe, the summer 2003 was
responsible for a high number of heat-related deaths, es-
pecially in Western Europe. Vienna was only partially af-
fected. The aim of this study is to compare the heat-related
mortality of 2003 with other years and to analyze whether
2003 was exceptional in Vienna.
Methods: The analysis is based on both meteorological
and mortality data for the federal state of Vienna (Austria)
for 1970–2007. We used the human-biometeorological in-
dex Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) in order
to assess the heat load affecting the human body, and con-
sidered short-term adaptation by the HeRATE approach.
Each day between April and October was classified ac-
cording to its thermal stress level and the mean mortality
for each class was analyzed. Two approaches, with and
without long-term sensitivity trends were considered.
Results: Mortality increases significantly with thermal
stress, but this increase attenuated in the last decades.
Based on the sensitivity for the period of investigation,
2003 was the year with the highest heat-related mortality.
Including the long-term sensitivity trend, other years
(1992, 1994 and 2000) were characterised by higher
values.
Discussion: In the last decades the number of days with
heat stress increased, but the sensitivity to heat stress de-
creased. This could indicate long-term adaptation proc-
esses. Hence, heat-related mortality in 2003 was high, but
not exceptionally high.},

Idea/Topic:
The paper investigates the influence of heat waves on mortality in Vienna.
Data/Method:
Mortality data from the federal state of Vienna as well as meteorological data from one station are used.
Finding/conclusion:
Mortality increases significantly with thermal stress. Within the investigated period (1970-2007) the number of days with heat stress increased on the one hand and on the other the sensitivity to heat-stress decreased. From this an possible adaptation of the population to heat-stress is concluded. Taking this into account the summers of 1992, 1994 and 2000 show a larger number of heat-related deaths than the meteorological exceptional summer of 2003.

Evaluation
The method described is interesting, i.e., taking into account the decreasing sensitivity of the population with respect to heat stress. Nevertheless, it is applied only to one city with one meteorological station to investigate whether the summer 2003 is exceptional with respect to heat-related deaths. Therefore it could serve as an example, but is in general of limited interest.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] A new approach defined here allows for the averaging of photochemistry over complex cloud fields within a grid square and can be readily implemented in current global models. As diagnosed from observations or meteorological models, fractional cloud cover with many overlying cloud layers can generate hundreds to thousands of different cloud profiles per grid square. We define a quadrature-based method, applied here to the problem of averaging photolysis rates over this range of cloud patterns, which opens new opportunities for modeling in-cloud chemistry in global models. We select up to four representative cloud profiles, optimizing the selection and weighting of each to minimize the difference in photolysis rates when compared with the integration over the entire set of cloud distributions. To implement our algorithm, we adapt the UCI fast-JX photolysis code to the cloud statistics from the ECMWF forecast model at T42L40 resolution. For the tropics and midlatitudes, grid-square-averaged photolysis rates for O-3, NO2, and NO3 using four representative atmospheres differ by at most 3.2% RMS from rates averaged over the hundreds or more cloudy atmospheres derived from a maximum-random overlap scheme. Further, bias errors in both the free troposphere and the boundary layer are less than 1%. Similar errors are shown to be 10-20% for current approximation methods. Errors in the quadrature method are less than the uncertainty in the choice of maximum-random overlap schemes. We apply the method to the averaging of photochemistry over different cloud profiles and outline extensions to heterogeneous cloud chemistry.},

A better approach for calculating photochemistry in a collumn atmosphere taking into account the clounds influencing the photolysis rate. Also meteorological parameters like short wave radiation are improved (as they are included in fast-JX).

Without fractional cloud cover (cloud uniformly distributed over the gridbox): Mean total optical depth (TOD). Reduced heating and photolysis rates below clouds, increased above.

Calculating random overlapping of all cloud layers is too expensive (near continuum).

Solution: taking 4 representative fractions in a gridbox with different "clouds" and calculate photochemistry for each of them. Combine the weighted fractions afterwards. (page 2 right top)

Seems to be much better than the averaging of the cloud layers.

Heterogeneous chemistry not calculated in this particular example.},

The anomaly grids were then combined with a 1961&#8211;90 mean monthly climatology (described in Part I) to arrive at grids of monthly climate over the 96-yr period. The primary variables&#8212;precipitation, mean temperature, and diurnal temperature range&#8212;were interpolated directly from station observations. The resulting time series are compared with other coarser-resolution datasets of similar temporal extent. The remaining climatic elements, termed secondary variables, were interpolated from merged datasets comprising station observations and, in regions where there were no station data, synthetic data estimated using predictive relationships with the primary variables. These predictive relationships are described and evaluated. It is argued that this new dataset represents an advance over other products because (i) it has higher spatial resolution than other datasets of similar temporal extent, (ii) it has longer temporal coverage than other products of similar spatial resolution, (iii) it encompasses a more extensive suite of surface climate variables than available elsewhere, and (iv) the construction method ensures that strict temporal fidelity is maintained. The dataset should be of particular relevance to a number of applications in applied climatology, including large-scale biogeochemical and hydrological modeling, climate change scenario construction, evaluation of regional climate models, and comparison with satellite products. The dataset is available from the Climatic Research Unit and is currently being updated to 1998.},

  Abstract                 = {A new cumulus convection parameterisation is presented in this paper. The parameterisation uses an explicit spectral approach and determines, unlike other convection schemes, for each convection event a new cloud distribution function regarding to the given vertical temperature and humidity profiles. This is done by using a one dimensional cloud model to create a spectrum of different clouds. The interaction between all non convective physical processes in the AGCM and all different clouds is taken into account to calculate a selfconsistent cloud spectrum. The model has been implemented in the ECHAM5 AGCM and tested against a large eddy simulation model. The representation of a shallow cumulus cloud field by the AGCM could be much improved. Diurnal cycle, cloud cover, liquid water path and the vertical structure of the mass flux, determined by the new convection scheme are close to the large eddy simulation, whereas the standard convection scheme failed in simulating this convection episode.},

  Abstract                 = {From recent satellite observations, it is evident that an increase in cloud condensation nuclei-for instance, due to biomass burning-can substantially reduce rain efficiency of convective clouds. This is potentially important for the global climate since the release of latent heat due to condensation of water vapour and fallout of rain from cumulus convection is the most important source for available potential energy in the free troposphere. Beyond this, cumulus convection is a key process in controlling the water vapour content of the atmosphere. The sensitivity of the global climate to modification in rain efficiency of convective clouds due to the suppression of drop coalescence by anthropogenic aerosols is studied by using the atmospheric general circulation model (A-GCM), ECHAM4. This paper presents results from a 15-year sensitivity study, which considers the aerosol effect on warm precipitation formation. Effects on ice processes are not included yet, and therefore the results likely underestimate the magnitude of the full effects due to suppression of precipitation. Instantaneous forcing is large locally (up to 100% reduction of precipitation and the related latent heat release) but confined to small areas, leading to small large-scale mean anomalies in the convective heating and therefore the vertical temperature gradient. We found a definite perturbation of the global circulation, showing distinct sensitivity to the impact of aerosols on suppressing rainfall. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) instrument measures carbon monoxide (CO) in the middle troposphere from a space platform. In anticipation of the deployment of MAPS aboard the space shuttle. Endeavor for two 10-day missions in 1994, plans were made to prepare a set of correlative measurements which would be used as part of the mission validation program. Eleven laboratories participated in the correlative measurement program by providing NASA with the results of their CO field programs during April and October 1994. Measurements of CO in the boundary layer, while not used in the MAPS validation, provide a picture of CO in the lower troposphere. Because measurements of CO made by different laboratories have been known to differ significantly, all correlative team members participated in an intercomparison of their measurements to define potential differences in techniques and calibration scales. While good agreement was found between some laboratories, there were differences between others. The use of similar analytical techniques and calibration scales did not always provide similar results. The results of the intercomparisons were used to normalize all ground-based measurements to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory CO reference scale. These data provide an internally consistent picture of CO in the lower atmosphere during spring and fall 1994.},

  Abstract                 = {Since 1988, the distribution of carbon monoixde (CO) in the lower troposphere has been determined using a globally distributed air sampling network. Site locations range from 82 degrees N to 90 degrees S, with wide longitudinal coverage, and represent the marine boundary layer, regionally polluted atmospheres, and the free troposphere. These measurements present a unique, intercalibrated, and internally consistent data set that are used to better define the global temporal and spatial distribution of CO. In this paper, times series from 49 sites are discussed. With an average lifetime of similar to 2 months, CO showed significant concentration gradients. In the lowest in the southern summer (35-45 ppb). The interhemispheric gradients showed strong seasonality with a minimum difference between the high latitudes of the northern and southern hemisphere (160-180 ppb) in February and March and a minimum in Jury and August (10-20 ppb). higher CO was found in regions near human development relative to those over more remote areas. The distributions provide additional evidence of the widespread pollution of the lower atmosphere. Remote areas in the high northern hemisphere are polluted by anthropogenic activities in the middle latitudes, and those in the southern hemisphere are heavily influence by the burning of biomass in the tropics. While tropospheric concentrations of CO exhibit periods of increase and decrease, the globally averaged CO mixing ratio over the period from 1990 through 1995 decreased at a rate of approximately 2 ppb yr(-1).},

All analysis is done by measurements on ca. 40 sites worldwide.

Mixing rates higher in NH than in SH. Highest values of CO in HNH (200-225 ppb) (high northern hemisphere) during winter and fall (low OH, high emissions). Lowest values occure during SH summer (35-40 ppb).

Normally CO maximum correlates with OH maximum. Shift due to biomass burning in the NH tropics.

Generally agreed: Four main sources of CO:
combustion of fossil fuels
biomass burning
oxidation of methane
oxidation of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs)

CO increase in fall and winter, decrease in spring.

Comparision of seasonal cycle of OH and CO can be used to study anthropogenic influences on CO.

SH:
OH lowest in June. CO-peak in September-October. Shift is due to emissions from biomass burning in the tropics.

 * with no human influence: CO inverse to OH (p.19024)
 * SH COmax (Sept-Oct) after OHmin (June) due to biomass burning
 * seasonal cycle dominated by biomass burning (p.19032)},

  Abstract                 = {For the past decade NOAA/CMDL has measured tropospheric carbon monoxide from a global network of sampling sites. The resulting data set provides an internally consistent picture of CO in the lower troposphere that is used to study its distribution, trends and budget. All measurements were referenced to the so-called CMDL Reference Scale (WMO 88), which was based on two sets of primary standards produced at CMDL during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A long-term downward trend in tropospheric CO during the 1990s, overlaid with shorter periods of increase and decrease, was indicated from the air measurements. Primary standards prepared in 1999 and 2000 suggested that the scale had drifted upward over time, and that mixing ratios determined in field samples were underestimated. We have applied a time dependent correction to our CO measurements based upon four sets of primary standards. In this paper, we describe the revision of the CO scale and our atmospheric measurements. A reanalysis of tropospheric trends through 2001 was based on the revised global data set. The results support previous reports of a decline in tropospheric CO. This decrease is now found largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere, where dramatic reductions in fossil fuel emissions have reportedly occurred. In contrast, no significant trend is determined in the Southern Hemisphere between 1991 and 2001. Globally averaged CO exhibits large interannual variability, primarily reflecting year to year changes in emissions from biomass burning. Dramatic enhancements of tropospheric CO in 1997 and 1998 resulted from exceptionally widespread wildfires which provided a strong pulse of CO to the atmosphere. In years of extensive boreal biomass burning, fire emissions can perturb CO levels over regional and global scales, disturbing oxidation/reduction chemistry in the troposphere.},

The air was collected as part of the CMDL/NOAA cooperative flask sampling program (Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory, formerly Geophysical Monitoring for Climatic Change, Air Resources Laboratory/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) at Point Barrow, Alaska (71-degrees-N). Niwot Ridge, Colorado (40-degrees-N), Mauna Loa and Cape Kumakahi, Hawaii (19-degrees-N), Guam, Marianas Islands (13-degrees-N), Christmas Island (2-degrees-N), Ascension Island (8-degrees-S) and American Samoa (14-degrees-S). Half-liter or 3-L glass flasks fitted with glass piston stopcocks holding teflon 0 rings were used for sample collection. CO levels were determined within several weeks of collection using gas chromatography followed by mercuric oxide reduction detection, and mixing ratios were referenced against the CMDL/NOAA carbon monoxide standard scale. During the period of study (mid-1988 through December 1990) CO levels were greatest in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere (mean mixing ratio from January 1989 to December 1990 at Point Barrow was approximately 154 ppb) and decreased towards the south (mean mixing ratio at Samoa over a similar period was 65 ppb). Mixing ratios varied seasonally, the amplitude of the seasonal cycle was greatest in the north and decreased to the south. Carbon monoxide levels were affected by both local and regional scale processes. The difference in CO levels between northern and southern latitudes also varied seasonally. The greatest difference in CO mixing ratios between Barrow and Samoa was observed during the northern winter (about 150 ppb). The smallest difference, 40 ppb, occurred during the austral winter. The annually averaged CO difference between 71-degrees-N and 14-degrees-S was approximately 90 ppb in both 1989 and 1990; the annually averaged interhemispheric gradient from 71-degrees-N to 41-degrees-S is estimated as approximately 95 ppb. },

Watershed Simulation and Forecasting System (WSFS) model was used to simulate surface water levels.
A coupled heat and mass transfer model for soil–plant–atmosphere systems (CoupModel) was used to
simulate recharge. The CoupModel is able to simulate water flow through frozen soil. The simulated sur-
face water level and recharge data were linked to the Groundwater Modelling System (GMS) version 6.5,
and the three-dimensional groundwater flow model MODFLOW was used to study the impact of climate
variability on groundwater levels and groundwater–surface water interactions. In addition, under A1B
climate change scenario changes in aquifer storage and groundwater–surface water interactions were
studied through the end of the 21st century. Recharge was shown to be sensitive to changes in soil frost
and hence modelling approaches should include a soil frost component to account for the impact of frost
on hydraulic conductivity. Under A1B climate change scenario study, groundwater recharge is projected
to increase in winter months due to increase in snowmelt and decrease in soil frost depth. The spring
snowmelt peak in late spring will decrease. This will reduce aquifer storage in early spring, increasing
the vulnerability to summer droughts.},

The paper investigates the influence of climate change on the groundwater-surface water resources (and the exchange between them), considering as a case study an equifer in a snow dominated region in northern Finland.

Data/Method 
Measurement data from the Pudasjärvi aquifer study site was used (e.g., groundwater levels between 1981 and 2000). Climate data from the AR4 was used for the A1B scenario as simulated by 19 general circulation models. Together with local observations, the delta-approach was used to assess climate change in the region.
The data was used together with a chain of three different models: one temperature and precipitation in the watershed, a 1-D model for coupled heat and mass transfer for soil-plant-atmosphere systems and one to simulate the groundwater flow.
One weakness of the method is the one-way approach (no influence of groundwater changes on surface water), which is argued to be reasonable in this specific region.
The models in the chain were not analyzed with respect to uncertainty.

Finding/Conclusion
The snowmelt period in spring is longer under climate change conditions and the snowmelt peak is shifted to earlier times in the year. Together with a greater annual recharge, the water potential of the aquifer is greater. A decrease in the amplitude of variation in surface water and groundwater levels are projected. Surface water infow to the aquifer is projected to occure more often.
Altogether, it is concluded that under A1B climate change scenario, groundwater discharge areas will be vulnerable to changes in groundwater-surface water exchange.

Evaluation
The study is quite interesting, but might be improved to be of general relevance. There are two main deficiencies: the missing uncertainty analysis of the different models in the model chain (and the resulting uncertainty of the entire chain) and the restriction to a one-way approach, which is not applicable in general to other regions.
The study serves as an example of what could happen to groundwater in the specific area.},

These data were analyzed to determine the factors controlling the relationship between O3 and NO y at this rural site. A strong association was observed between the O3 and NO x oxidation product (NO z = NO y â NO x ) levels. The higher O3 levels were associated with air masses impacted by higher NO x emissions that had been photochemically processed. An analysis of the data indicates that the ultimate O3 production is about 10 molecules of O3 produced for each molecule of NOx emitted. The analysis results also suggest that O3 net production continues until about 70% of the NO x has been converted into NO z . The PAN/HNO3 ratios observed suggest that the air masses in Giles County are composed of higher volatile organic carbon/NO x ratios than the air masses observed at other rural sites in eastern North America. A comparison of the data analysis results to model simulations and smog chamber experiments suggests that most of the time, Giles County is in an NO x -limited regime for O3 production.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional climate models are im- portant research tools available to scientists around the world, including in economically developing nations (EDNs). The Earth Systems Physics (ESP) group of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) maintains and distributes a state-of the-science regional climate model called the ICTP Regional Climate Model version 3 (RegCM3), which is currently being used by a large research community for a diverse range of climate-related studies. The RegCM3 is the central, but not only, tool of the ICTP-maintained Regional Climate Research Network (RegCNET) aimed at creating south-south and north-south scientific interactions on the topic of climate and associated impacts research and modeling. In this paper, RegCNET, RegCM3, and illustrative results from RegCM3 benchmark simulations applied over south Asia, Africa, and South America are presented. It is shown that RegCM3 performs reasonably well over these regions and is therefore useful for climate studies in EDNs.},

We describe the forward model that is used as the basis for the retrieval algorithm. We present the techniques used to model the instrument and describe the radiative transfer involved in the measurement process. Calculations have been performed to assess the sensitivity of the measured radiance to changes in the target-gas concentration profiles, changes in the concentration of contaminating constituents, and to variations in the parameters that describe reflection and emission of radiation at the Earth's surface.

  Abstract                 = {A retrieval method for deriving the tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) profile and column amount under clear sky conditions has been developed for the Measurements of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument, scheduled for launch in 1998 onboard the EOS-AMI satellite. This paper presents a description of the method along with analyses of retrieval information content, These analyses characterize the forward measurement sensitivity, the contribution of a priori information, and the retrieval vertical resolution. Ensembles of tropospheric CO profiles were compiled both from aircraft in situ measurements and from chemical model results and were used in retrieval experiments to characterize the method and to study the sensitivity to different parameters. Linear error analyses were carried out in parallel with the ensemble experiments. Results of these experiments and analyses indicate that MOPITT CO column measurements will have better than 10% precision, and CO profile measurement will have approximately three pieces of independent information that will resolve 3-5 tropospheric layers to approximately 10% precision. These analyses are important for understanding MOPITT data, both for application of data in tropospheric chemistry studies and for comparison with in situ measurements.},

The paper gives an overview over the influence of climate change on mycotoxin production in food crops. It is a literature review with respect to possible global and regional changes in funghi and toxin production with a special focus on mycotoxin. Analysis are done in a quantitative way using general statements of the last IPCC report (2007). From this information and different mycotoxin production conditions, general statements about the future production of mycotoxins are derived for different areas.

Evaluation

The paper is highly specialized on mycotoxin and very general in terms of how the production is changing in different regions (continents). These deductions are too vague to be interesting for a general public. A more detailed assessment would be necessary to take into account more factors of toxin production. There are no really new findings.},

The targeted time period is from April 2000 to March 2001. A sequential and time-dependent inversion scheme is implemented to correct an a priori set of monthly mean CO sources. The a posteriori estimates for the total anthropogenic (fossil fuel + biofuel + biomass burning) surface sources of CO in TgCO/yr are 509 in Asia, 267 in Africa, 140 in North America, 90 in Europe and 84 in Central and South America. Inverting on a monthly scale allows one to assess a corrected seasonality specific to each source type and each region. Forward CTM simulations with the a posteriori emissions show a substantial improvement of the agreement between modeled CO and independent in situ observations.},

  Abstract                 = {A regional climate model has been used to study the transport and deposition of sulfur (SO2 and SO42-) and PbCl2 emissions from Indonesian volcanoes. The sensitivity of the atmospheric loss of these trace species to meteorological conditions and their solubility was examined. Two experiments were conducted: 1) volcanic sulfur released as primarily SO2 and subject to transport, deposition, and oxidation to SO42-; and 2) PbCl2 released as an infinitely soluble passive tracer subject to only transport and deposition. The first experiment was used to calculate SO2 loss rates from each active Indonesian volcano producing an annual mean loss rate for all volcanoes of 1.1 x 10(-5) s(-1), or an e-folding rate of approximately 1 day. SO2 loss rate was found to vary seasonally, be poorly correlated with wind speed, and uncorrelated with temperature or relative humidity. The variability of SO2 loss rates is found to be correlated with the variability of wind speeds, suggesting that it is much more difficult to establish a "typical" SO2 loss rate for volcanoes that are exposed to changeable winds. Within an average distance of 70 km away from the active Indonesian volcanoes, 53% of SO2 loss is due to conversion to SO42-, 42% due to dry deposition, and 5% due to lateral transport away from the dominant direction of plume travel. The solubility of volcanic emissions in water is shown to influence their atmospheric transport and deposition. High concentrations of PbCl2 are predicted to be deposited near to the volcanoes while volcanic S travels further away until removal from the atmosphere primarily via the wet deposition of H2SO4. The ratio of the concentration of PbCl2 to SO2 is found to exponentially decay at increasing distance from the volcanoes. The more rapid removal of highly soluble species should be considered when observing SO2 in an aged plume and relating this concentration to other volcanic species. An assumption that the ratio between the concentrations of highly soluble volcanic compounds and SO2 within a plume is equal to that observed in fumarolic gases is reasonable at small distances from the volcanic vent, but will result in an underestimation of the emission flux of highly soluble species.},

  Abstract                 = {CO is a well-suited indicator for the transport of pollutants in the troposphere on a regional and global scale. For the study presented here, simulations of CO concentrations from a global chemistry transport model (MOZART-2), with the CO being tagged according to the emission type and the source region, have been used to diagnose the contributions of different processes and regions to the CO burden over Europe. Model simulations have been performed with both a priori emissions and an optimized set of CO surface emissions derived from the inversion of CO retrievals of the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) remote sensing instrument. The annual mean difference between the modeled and the observed CO at 850 hPa over Europe is -38 +/- 13 ppb with the a priori set of emissions and -7 +/- 7 ppb when the optimized emissions are employed in the model. The general difficulties arising from an intercomparison of remote sensing data with model simulations are discussed. Besides data from MOPITT, ground-based CO measurements have been employed in the evaluation of the model and its emissions. The comparisons show that the model represents the background conditions as well as large-scale transport relatively well. The budget analysis reveals the predominant impact of the European emissions on CO concentrations near the surface, and a strong impact of sources from Asia and North America on the CO burden in the free troposphere over Europe. On average, the largest contribution (67%) to the anthropogenic (fossil and biofuel sources, biomass burning) CO at the surface originates from regional anthropogenic sources, but further significant impact is evident from North America (14%) and Asia (15%). With increasing altitude, anthropogenic CO from Asia and North America gains in importance, reaching maximum contributions of 32% for North American CO at 500 hPa and 50% for Asian CO at 200 hPa. The impact of European emissions weakens with increasing altitude (8% at 500 hPa).},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Global ozone analyses, based on assimilation of stratospheric profile and ozone column measurements, and NOy predictions from the Real-time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) are used to estimate the ozone and NOy budget over the continental United States during the July - August 2004 Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment - North America (INTEX-A). Comparison with aircraft, satellite, surface, and ozonesonde measurements collected during INTEX-A show that RAQMS captures the main features of the global and continental U. S. distribution of tropospheric ozone, carbon monoxide, and NOy with reasonable fidelity. Assimilation of stratospheric profile and column ozone measurements is shown to have a positive impact on the RAQMS upper tropospheric/lower stratosphere ozone analyses, particularly during the period when SAGE III limb scattering measurements were available. Eulerian ozone and NOy budgets during INTEX-A show that the majority of the continental U. S. export occurs in the upper troposphere/ lower stratosphere poleward of the tropopause break, a consequence of convergence of tropospheric and stratospheric air in this region. Continental U. S. photochemically produced ozone was found to be a minor component of the total ozone export, which was dominated by stratospheric ozone during INTEX-A. The unusually low photochemical ozone export is attributed to anomalously cold surface temperatures during the latter half of the INTEX-A mission, which resulted in net ozone loss during the first 2 weeks of August. Eulerian NOy budgets are shown to be very consistent with previously published estimates. The NOy export efficiency was estimated to be 24%, with NOx + PAN accounting for 54% of the total NOy export during INTEX-A.},

In this paper, we estimate this effect within the ClOVER experiment observing bands (97, 150 and 220 GHz) for the selected observing site (Llano de Chajnantor, Atacama desert, Chile). The results show that the polarization signal from the clouds can be of the order of or even bigger than the cosmic microwave background expected polarization. Climatological data suggest that this signal is fairly constant over the whole year in Antarctica. On the other hand, the stronger seasonal variability in Atacama allows for a 50 per cent of clean observations during the dry season.},

  Abstract                 = {The land surface is a key component of climate models. It controls the
partitioning of available energy at the surface between sensible and
latent heat, and it controls the partitioning of available water between
evaporation and runoff. The land surface is also the location of the
terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence is increasing that the influence of
the land surface is significant on climate and that changes in the land
surface can influence regional- to global-scale climate on time scales
from days to millennia. Further, there is now a suggestion that the
terrestrial carbon sink may decrease as global temperatures increase as
a consequence of rising CO2 levels. This paper provides the theoretical
background that explains why the land surface should play a central role
in climate. It also provides evidence, sourced from climate model
experiments, that the land surface is of central importance. This paper
then reviews the development of land surface models designed for climate
models from the early, very simple models through to recent efforts,
which include a coupling of biophysical processes to represent carbon
exchange. It is pointed out that significant problems remain to be
addressed, including the difficulties in parameterizing hydrological
processes, root processes, sub-grid-scale heterogeneity and
biogeochemical cycles. It is argued that continued development of land
surface models requires more multidisciplinary efforts by scientists
with a wide range of skills. However, it is also argued that the
framework is now in place within the international community to build
and maintain the latest generation of land surface models. Further,
there should be considerable optimism that consolidating the recent
rapid advances in land surface modelling will enhance our capability to
simulate the impacts of land-cover change and the impacts of increasing
CO2 on the global and regional environment.

  Abstract                 = {A simple non-local closure model for vertical mixing in Convective Boundary Layers (CBL) has been developed specifically for application in regional or mesoscale atmospheric chemistry models. The model, named the Asymmetrical Convective Model (ACM), is based on the concept that vertical transport within the CBL is inherently asymmetrical. Upward transport by buoyant plumes originating in the surface layer is simulated by mixing from the lowest model layer directly to all other layers in the CBL. Downward transport, however, proceeds only to the next layer in order to emulate gradual compensatory subsidence. The ACM is similar to the model developed by Blackadar (1978, 4th Symp. on Atmospheric Turbulence, Diffusion and Air Quality, pp. 443-447, Reno, Am. Meteorol. Soc.) but differs in its treatment of downward transport. The realism of the ACM is tested through comparisons to large-eddy simulations of several idealized test cases. These tests show that while the ACM shares the Blackadar model's ability to simulate rapid transport upward from the surface layer to all levels in the CBL, it is clearly superior in its treatment of material emitted from elevated sources either within or above the CBL. The ACM is also tested in the context of the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM) both to determine sensitivity to different CBL mixing schemes and to compare to vertically resolved aircraft measurements. These tests demonstrate quicker upward transport of ground-level emissions by the ACM as compared to the eddy diffusion scheme currently used in RADM. The ACM also affects ozone photochemistry in the boundary layer resulting in lower ozone concentrations in areas of high NOx emissions.},

  Abstract                 = {A nested grid version of the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM) has been developed. The horizontal grid interval size of the nested model is 3 times smaller than that of RADM (80/3 km = 26.7 km). Therefore the nested model is better able to simulate mesoscale atmospheric processes while maintaining consistency with larger-scale features. The nested model uses dynamic boundary conditions along inflow boundaries which are interpolated from coarse grid model (RADM) results. Since the nesting is one-way, the outflow boundary conditions are specified to minimize numerical reflections. Three-day wet deposition amounts of sulfate and nitrate simulated by the nested grid version of RADM as well as the coarse grid version were compared to measurements made by the regional scale network during the Oxidizing and Scavenging Characteristics of April Rains (OSCAR) IV experiment. Both models were able to predict wet depositions of sulfate to within a factor of 2 for over 80% of the sampling sites. Nitrate predictions were slightly worse with just over 70% of the pairs within a factor of two for both models. Although the nested grid model showed no improvement over the coarse grid model in terms of point by point comparisons, it did demonstrate the ability to predict a more realistic range and spatial variability of wet deposition amounts. Plots of predicted deposition fields show that the nested model predicted values similar to the observations in their vicinity more often than did the coarse grid model. Nested model simulations of wet deposition were also compared to measurements made by a high density sampling network over a 110 x 110 km area of northeastern Indiana. Most of the spatial features of the observed distribution were well simulated by the model demonstrating the nested model's ability to resolve processes on scales which are subgrid to the coarse grid model. The predictions of wet depositions by both models were in better agreement with observations than were predictions of precipitation. Since the OSCAR IV experiment was characterized by very efficient washout, the rate of wet deposition was often primarily controlled by the rate of supply of airborne material to the precipitating system rather than aqueous oxidation and precipitation processes. Therefore, errors in precipitation rate had little impact on wet deposition predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {Biomass burning in the tropics contributes substantially to the emission of organic compounds and nitrogen oxides into the troposphere and has an important impact on the global budget of ozone in the troposphere. Since ozone formation is a nonlinear chemical process the rate of formation is also influenced by atmospheric dilution and,transport. This paper addresses the production of ozone in a plume emerging from a biomass burning site. Atmospheric mixing processes downwind the fire are expected to influence the total amount of ozone produced. A sensitivity study to assess the influence of dilution on the maximum ozone mixing ratio and on the amount of ozone formed in the entire plume (excess ozone) reveals that both quantities depend strongly on the time scale and the final value of the dilution. Up to 70 % difference of the excess ozone as function of the characteristic time of the dilution was observed. Since many global models do not treat the early development of the plume with sufficient resolution in space and time a substantial uncertainty of model predicted ozone formation from biomass burning plumes is to be expected.},

  Abstract                 = {Aerosols are of central importance for atmospheric chemistry and
physics, the biosphere, climate, and public health. The airborne solid
and liquid particles in the nanometer to micrometer size range influence
the energy balance of the Earth, the hydrological cycle, atmospheric
circulation, and the abundance of greenhouse and reactive trace
gases. Moreover, they play important roles in the reproduction of
biological organisms and can cause or enhance diseases. The primary
parameters that determine the environmental and health effects of
aerosol particles are their concentration, size, structure, and chemical
composition. These parameters, however, are spatially and temporally
highly variable. The quantification and identification of biological
particles and carbonaceous components of fine particulate matter in
the air (organic compounds and black or elemental carbon, respectively)
represent demanding analytical challenges. This Review
outlines the current state of knowledge, major open questions, and
research perspectives on the properties and interactions of atmospheric
aerosols and their effects on climate and human health.},

  Abstract                 = {{[}1] Clouds can significantly affect photochemical activities in the boundary layer by altering radiation intensity, and therefore their correct specification in the air quality models is of outmost importance. In this study we introduce a technique for using the satellite observed clouds to correct photolysis rates in photochemical models. This technique was implemented in EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) and was tested over a 10 day period in August 2000 that coincided with the Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS). The simulations were performed at 4 and 12 km grid size domains over Texas, extending east to Mississippi, for the period of 24 to 31 August 2000. The results clearly indicate that inaccurate cloud prediction in the model can significantly alter the predicted atmospheric chemical composition within the boundary layer and exaggerate or underpredict ozone concentration. Cloud impact is acute and more pronounced over the emission source regions and can lead to large errors in the model predictions of ozone and its by-products. At some locations the errors in ozone concentration reached as high as 60 ppb which was mostly corrected by the use of our technique. Clouds also increased the lifetime of ozone precursors leading to their transport out of the source regions and causing further ozone production down-wind. Longer lifetime for nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and its transport over regions high in biogenic hydrocarbon emissions ( in the eastern part of the domain) led to increased ozone production that was missing in the control simulation. Over Houston-Galveston Bay area, the presence of clouds altered the chemical composition of the atmosphere and reduced the net surface removal of reactive nitrogen compounds. Use of satellite observed clouds significantly improved model predictions in areas impacted by clouds. Errors arising from an inconsistency in the cloud fields can impact the performance of photochemical models used for case studies as well as for air quality forecasting. Air quality forecast models often use the model results from the previous forecast ( or some adjusted form of it) for the initialization of the new forecast. Therefore such errors can propagate into the future forecasts, and the use of observed clouds in the preparation of initial concentrations for air quality forecasting could be beneficial.},

  Abstract                 = {Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) observations in cloud systems are studied over the tropics. Over optically thick cloud systems, the presence of polarized signatures at 37 and 85 GHz is evidenced and analyzed with the help of cloud top temperature and optical thickness extracted from visible and IR satellite observations. Scattering signatures at 85 GHz (TbV(85)less than or equal to 250 K) are associated with polarization differences greater than or equal to 6 K similar to 50% of the time over ocean and similar to 40% over land. In addition, over thick clouds the polarization difference at 37 GHz rarely is negligible. The polarization differences at 37 and 85 GHz do not stem from the surface but are generated in regions of relatively homogeneous clouds having high liquid water content. To interpret the observations, a radiative transfer model that includes the scattering by nonspherical particles is developed, based on the T matrix approach and using the doubling and adding method. In addition to handling randomly and perfectly oriented particles this model can also simulate the effect of partial orientation of the hydrometeors. Microwave brightness temperatures are simulated at SSM/I frequencies and are compared with the observations. Polarization differences of similar to 2 K can be simulated at 37 GHz over a rain layer, even using spherical drops. The polarization difference is larger for oriented nonspherical particles. The 85 GHz simulations are very sensitive to the ice phase of the cloud. Simulations with spherical particles or with randomly oriented nonspherical ice particles cannot replicate the observed polarization differences. However, with partially oriented nonspherical particles the observed polarized signatures at 85 GHz are explained, and the sensitivity of the scattering characteristics to the particle size, asphericity, and orientation is analyzed. Implications on rain and ice retrievals are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The launch of the eighth Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-8) in 1994 introduced an improved capability for diurnal fire and smoke monitoring throughout the western hemisphere. In South America the GOES-8 automated biomass burning algorithm (ABBA) and the automated smoke/aerosol detection algorithm (ASADA) are being used to monitor biomass burning. This paper outlines GOES-8 ABBA and ASADA development activities and summarizes results for the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation in Brazil (SCAR-B) experiment and the 1995 fire season. GOES-8 ABBA results document the diurnal, spatial, and seasonal variability in fire activity throughout South America. A validation exercise compares GOES-8 ABBA results with ground truth measurements for two SCAR-B prescribed burns. GOES-8 ASADA aerosol coverage and derived albedo results provide an overview of the extent of daily and seasonal smoke coverage and relative intensities. Day-to-day variability in smoke extent closely tracks fluctuations in fire activity.},

  Abstract                 = {We document a new middle atmosphere general circulation model that includes ozone photochemistry. The dynamical model component is based on the NCAR middle atmosphere version of the Community Climate Model. The chemistry model component simulates the evolution of 24 chemically reactive gases. The horizontal resolution is approximately 3 degrees in latitude and 6 degrees in longitude. It includes 44 levels, with a maximum vertical grid spacing of about 2.5 km and a top level at around 75 km. The chemical model distinguishes between species where we judge transport to be critical and those for which it may be neglected. Nine longer-lived species (N2O, CH4, H2O, HNO3, N2O5, CO, ClONO2, HCl, and HOCl) and four chemical families (NOy, NOx, O-x and Cl-x) are advected. Concentrations of 15 species which are typically shorter-lived or are members of the chemical families are diagnosed using quasi-equilibrium assumptions (O(D-1), OH, Cl, O(P-3), O-3, HO2, NO2, ClO, NO, HNO4, NO3, N, OClO, Cl2O2, H2O2). Distributions for a number of other species are prescribed. Results are presented from a 2-year simulation, which include only gas phase photochemical reactions and in which the ozone distribution forecast from the chemistry module does not affect the radiative forcing of the dynamical fields. The calculated distributions of trace species and their seasonal evolution are often quite realistic, particularly in the northern hemisphere extratropics. Distributions of long-lived species such as N2O and CH4 correspond well to satellite observations. Some features, such as the double peak structure occurring during equinoxes, are not reproduced. The latitudinal variation and seasonal evolution of the ozone column abundance is quite realistic. The calculated vertical distribution of the ozone mixing ratio exhibits significant differences from measured values. The model underestimates significantly the ozone in the upper stratosphere (40 km) and in the extratropics, where the maximum values occur at too low an altitude. The model reproduces the key features expected in the distribution of fast reacting nitrogen and chlorine compounds. Problems in the southern polar simulation (which we attribute to the lack of a comprehensive parameterization of gravity waves) are discussed. The model currently parameterizes only stationary gravity waves generated by flow over orography. Other sources of gravity waves may be required to improve the model simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study the regional climate model of the German Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology (REMO) is used to analyse the effect of monthly varying vegetation on the simulated climate in Europe. For this investigation the annual cycle of vegetation is implemented in the land Surface parameterization scheme of REMO. As input data Source a new global dataset of land surface parameters is used. It contains monthly varying vegetation parameter values for leaf area index, fractional vegetation cover and background surface albedo. This dataset is adapted to both standard REMO model domains at 0.5 degree and 0.16 degree horizontal resolution focusing Europe. For both resolutions present-day climate simulations are performed to examine the sensitivity of REMO to the modified vegetation parameterization. The simulation results are compared to corresponding reference simulations where vegetation parameter values are held constant in time. A validation is done by the comparison of the model results with several gridded observational datasets. A significant influence of monthly varying vegetation on the regional climate can be demonstrated. Vertical surface fluxes, near surface temperature and precipitation are strongly affected. The temporal analysis of the results reveals that the vegetation effect on the simulated climate occurs mainly in the summer season. In general, the simulated near-surface climate becomes cooler and wetter during the growing season. Concerning the spatial resolution, main effects can be detected in eastern Europe and the Hungarian lowlands. In these regions the more realistic vegetation treatment improves the simulated mean annual cycles of 2 m temperature and precipitation with respect to the observations.},

  Abstract                 = {A semi-implicit time integration algorithm developed earlier for a barotropic model resulted in an appreciable economy of computing time. An extension of this method to baroclinic models is formulated, including a description of the various steps in the calculations. In the proposed scheme, the temperature is separated into a basic part dependent only on the vertical coordinate and a corresponding perturbation part. All terms involving the perturbation temperature are calculated from current values of the variables, while a centered finite-difference time average is applied to the horizontal pressure gradient, the divergence, and the vertical motion in the remaining terms. This method gives computationally stable integra- tions with relatively large time steps. The model used to test the semi-implicit scheme does not include topography, precipitation, diabatic heating, and other important physical processes. Five-day hemis- pheric integrations from real data with time steps of 60 and 30 min show differences of the order of 3 m. These errors are insignificant when compared to other sources of error normally present in most numerical models. Pres- ently, this model produces relatively good short-range predictions, and this is a strong factor in favor of inserting the major physical processes as soon as possible.},

The main focus is on the results from the standard 50&nbsp;km-resolution runs of eight regional models. The best parameter for determining possible future changes in extreme wind speeds and possible change in the number of storm events is maximum daily wind speed. It turned out during this study that the method for calculating maximum daily wind speed differs among the regional models. A comparison of simulated winds with observations for the control period shows that models without gust parameterisation are not able to realistically capture high wind speeds. The two models with gust parametrization estimate an increase of up to 20% of the number of storm peak (defined as gustsââ¥â8&nbsp;Bft in this paper) events over Central Europe in the future. In order to use a larger ensemble of models than just the two with gust parameterisation, we also look at the 99th percentile of daily mean wind speed. We divide Europe into eight sub-regions (e.g., British Isles, Iberian Peninsula, NE Europe) and investigate the inter-monthly variation of wind over these regions as well as differences between todayâs climate and a possible future climate. Results show differences and similarities between the sub-regions in magnitude, spread, and seasonal tendencies. The model ensemble indicates a possible increase in future mean daily wind speed during winter months, and a decrease during autumn in areas influenced by North Atlantic extra-tropical cyclones.},

Gust parameterisation is necessary to assess the future maximum wind speed.

Majour outcome: like in other studies, they found an increase in extreme wind speeds over Western and Central Europe. But they are not statistically significant for each month of the year.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of melt ponds on Arctic sea ice is estimated from model simulations of the historical and future climate. The simulations were performed with and without the effect of melt ponds on sea ice melt, respectively. In the last thirty years of the historical simulations, melt ponds develop predominantly in the continental shelf regions and in the Canadian archipelago. Accordingly, the ice albedo in these regions is systematically smaller than in the no-pond simulations, the sea ice melt is enhanced, and both the ice concentration and ice thickness during the September minimum are reduced. Open ponds decrease the ice albedo, resulting in enhanced ice melt, less sea ice and further pond growth. This positive feedback entails a more realistic representation of the seasonal cycle of Northern Hemisphere sea ice area. Under the premise that the observed decline of Arctic sea ice over the period of modern satellite observations is mainly externally driven and, therefore, potentially predictable, both model versions underestimate the decline in Arctic sea ice. This presupposition, however, is challenged by our model simulations which show a distinct modulation of the downward Arctic sea ice trends by multidecadal variability. At longer time scales, an impact of pond activation on Arctic sea ice trends is more evident: In the Representative Concentration Pathway scenario RCP45, the September sea ice is projected to vanish by the end of the 21st century. In the active-pond simulation, this happens up to two decades earlier than in the no-pond simulations.},

Although there is no clear cut 'best' algorithm, several conclusions can be made. Spectral and pseudospectral techniques consistently provide the highest degree of accuracy, but expense and difficulties assuring positive mixing ratios are serious drawbacks. Schemes which consider fluid slabs bounded by grid points (volume schemes), rather than the simple specification of constituent values at the grid points, provide accurate positive definite results.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the reasons for the opposite climate change signals in
precipitation between the regional climate model REMO and its driving earth system
model MPI-ESM over the greater Congo region. Three REMO simulations following three
RCP scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) are conducted, and it is found that the
opposite signals, with REMO showing a decrease and MPI-ESM an increase in the future
precipitation, diverge strongly as we move from a less extreme to a more extreme scenario.
It has been shown that REMO simulates a much higher number of extreme rainfall events
than MPI-ESM. This results in higher surface runoff and thus less soil infiltration, which
leads to lower amounts of soil moisture in REMO. This further leads to less moisture
recycling via evapotranspiration, which in turn results in less precipitation over the region.
In the presence of a strong radiative forcing, the hydrological cycle becomes less intense in
REMO and a downward trend in hydrological variables is observed. Contrary to this, the
higher amounts of soil-moisture due to the lack of extreme rainfall events in MPI-ESM
enhance the hydrological cycle. In the presence of strong radiative forcing, higher amounts
of soil moisture result in increased evapotranspiration which in turn results in the higher
amount of precipitation. It is concluded that the land-atmosphere coupling over the Congo
region is very sensitive to the change in soil moisture amounts, which is likely to play a
major role in global warming conditions. Therefore, adequate and improved representation
of soil processes in climate models is essential to study the effects of climate change.
However, the better representation of extreme rainfall events in REMO compared to
MPI-ESM can be regarded as an added value of the model.},

The synoptic conditions, which prevailed during the period, have been identified. The behavior of these large-scale systems namely the relative positions, the nature and the types of the anticyclone or cold front (CF) has been investigated, and for each identified synoptic situation, trace elements concentrations have been determined, During the CF synoptic condition, the elements presented low concentrations associated with intense ventilation, precipitation and high relative humidity. It is seen that for both the synoptic conditions namely the South Atlantic Subtropical High and Polar High, high values of concentrations prevailed due to weak ventilation, low relative humidity and absence of precipitation, The micro and mesoscale meteorological conditions have also been studied for a day with low and a day with high concentration of particulate pollutants. Finally, applying receptor modeling to the fine aerosol mass concentration data set, five categories of emission sources in the MASP were identified: vehicles, garbage incineration, vegetation, suspend soil dust and burning of fuel oil.

  Abstract                 = {The Mediterranean basin is a region characterized by its vulnerability to changes in the water cycle. Hence, the impact of global warming on the water resources in the Mediterranean zone is one of the major concerns for the scientific community. The future climate projections used to elaborate the IPCC report of 2007 show great alterations in the evaporation and precipitation over the Mediterranean Sea at the end of 21st century. In this work we investigate the changes in the Mediterranean Sea water budget by using SRES-A1B scenario experiments performed with high resolution (25 km) regional climate models (RCMs). The RCMs provide good estimates of the water budget components, in particular with a significant improvement of the runoff and Black Sea discharge terms compared to the coarser resolution general circulation models (GCMs) used in the last Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) report. As for the case of GCMs, the RCMs show that the Mediterranean water budget is likely to be significantly altered at the end of 21st century. The response of the hydrological variables to global warming starts to be statistically significant from 2050, though some alterations are already observed before 2050. The RCMs predict an increase of evaporation, and a decrease of precipitation, and river and Black Sea discharge, yielding to a large increase of the Mediterranean fresh water deficit.

  Abstract                 = {[1] We quantify the processes controlling the tropical tropospheric ozone burden with particular attention to the tropical Atlantic, using a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) constrained by satellite and in situ observations of O-3, NO2, and HCHO. Lightning is the dominant contributor to tropical tropospheric O-3, accounting for more than 37% of the O-3 burden over the Atlantic on annual average. The contributions from biomass burning, soils, and fossil fuels are 4 to 6 times smaller, despite comparable source strengths. This discrepancy can be explained by the tropical ozone production efficiency of lightning ( 32 mol/ mol), soils ( 14 mol/ mol), biomass burning ( 10 mol/ mol), and fossil fuel ( 13 mol/ mol) sources, as calculated using sensitivity simulations with a 1% perturbation. The role of volatile organic compound emissions on the tropical Atlantic ozone burden is negligible (< 2.5%). Stratosphere-troposphere exchange accounts for less than 5% of the regional O-3 burden. The tropical Atlantic O-3 burden is more strongly influenced by nitrogen oxides from Africa (> 30%) than from South America (> 18%) or the eastern tropics (> 11%). Lightning is responsible for more than 39% of the atmospheric oxidation capacity, higher than other sources. The dominant sources of uncertainty in the tropical oxidation rate are the lightning magnitude and the cloud convective parameterization.},

  Abstract                 = {The user's guide for the photochemical box model (PBM) describes the structure and operation of the model and its preprocessors and provides the potential user with guidance in setting up input data. The PBM is a simple stationary single-cell model with a variable height lid designed to provide volume-integrated hour averages of O3 and other photochemical smog pollutants of interest for an urban area for a single day of simulation. The PBM is most appropriate for application in air stagnation conditions with light and variable winds. The PBM assumes that emission sources are homogeneously distributed across the surface face of the box volume and that the volume is well mixed at all times. The user must provide the PBM with initial species concentrations, hourly inputs of wind speed, source emission fluxes of CO, NC(x), THC, and hydrocarbon reactivity classes, and boundary species concentrations. Values of measured solar radiation and mixed layer depth may be specified at subhourly intervals throughout a simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the ultimate change in global mean temperature in response to a change in external forcing. Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

  Abstract                 = {Research over the past ten years has created a more detailed and coherent view of the relation between O-3 and its major anthropogenic precursors, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). This article presents a review of insights derived from photochemical models and field measurements. The ozone-precursor relationship can be understood in terms of a fundamental split into a NOx-senstive and VOC-sensitive (or NOx-saturated) chemical regimes. These regimes are associated with the chemistry of odd hydrogen radicals and appear in different forms in studies of urbanized regions, power plant plumes and the remote troposphere. Factors that affect the split into NO, sensitive and VOC-sensitive chemistry include: VOC/NOx ratios, VOC reactivity, biogenic hydrocarbons, photochemical aging, and rates of meteorological dispersion. Analyses of ozone-NOx-VOC sensitivity from 3D photochemical models show a consistent pattern, but predictions for the impact of reduced NOx and VOC in indivdual locations are often very uncertain. This uncertainty can be identified by comparing predictions from different model scenarios that reflect uncertainties in meteorology, anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. Several observation-based approaches have been proposed that seek to evaluate ozone-NOx-VOC sensitivity directly from ambient measurements (including ambient VOC, reactive nitrogen, and peroxides). Observation-based approaches have also been used to evaluate emission rates, ozone production efficiency, and removal rates of chemically active species. Use of these methods in combination with models can significantly reduce the uncertainty associated with model predictions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The indicator species correlations are based on a series of photochemical simulations with varying rates of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and meteorology. Hydrocarbon-sensitive chemistry in models is shown to be linked to afternoon NO y > 20 ppb, O3/(NO y - NO x ) < 7, HCHO/NO y < 0.28, and H2O2/HNO3 < 0.4. Lower NO y and higher ratios correspond with NO x -sensitive ozone. The correlation between NO x -hydrocarbon sensitivity and indicator species remains, even when model emission rates and hydrocarbon/NO x ratios are changed by a factor of 2. Methods are developed for evaluating the goodness of fit between model NO x -hydrocarbon sensitivity and indicator values. Ozone chemistry is also analyzed in terms of fundamental properties of odd hydrogen, and theoretical criteria for the transition between NO x - and hydrocarbon-sensitive regimes are derived. A theoretical correlation between O3 and H2O2 + NO y - NO x is developed as a way to extend rural O3-NO y correlations into urban locations. Measured indicator values during pollution events in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and rural Virginia are used to illustrate the range of observed values under different environmental conditions.},

Measurements included O3, primary reactive organic gases (ROG), aldehydes, PAN, total reactive nitrogen (NOy) and H2O2, with vertical profiles for primary ROG. Photochemical models using two different chemical representations and a range of assumptions about winds, vertical mixing and emissions were used to simulate the event. Results show that assumptions about vertical mixing can cause a variation in simulated surface concentrations of primary hydrocarbons of a factor of two or more. A tendency to underestimate isoprene was found in comparison with measured vertical profiles. The models tend to overestimate concentrations of HCHO, H202 and PAN in comparison with measurements. Peak O3 and concurrent NOy from helicopter measurements was used as a basis for evaluating individual model scenarios. Scenarios were developed with different O3 NOx- ROG sensitivity, but only the NOx- sensitive scenarios are consistent with measured O3, NOy and isoprene.},

  Abstract                 = {An evaluation of the present-day climate in South America simulated by the MPI atmospheric limited area model, REMO, is made. The model dataset was generated by dynamical downscaling from the ECMWF-ERA40 reanalysis and compared to in-situ observations. The model is able to reproduce the low-level summer monsoon circulation but it has some deficiencies in representing the South American Low-Level Jet structure. At upper levels, summer circulation features like the Bolivian High and the associated subtropical jet are well simulated by the model. Sea-level pressure fields are in general well represented by REMO. The model exhibits reasonable skill in representing the general features of the mean seasonal cycle of precipitation. Nevertheless, there is a systematic overestimation of precipitation in both tropical and subtropical regions. Differences between observed and modeled temperature are smaller than 1.5°C over most of the continent, excepting during spring when those differences are quite large. Results also show that the dynamical downscaling performed using REMO introduces some enhancement of the global reanalysis especially in temperature at the tropical regions during the warm season and in precipitation in both the subtropics and extratropics. It is then concluded that REMO can be a useful tool for regional downscaling of global simulations of present and future climates.},

  Abstract                 = {An energy and angular-momentum conserving vertical finite-difference scheme is introduced for a general terrain-following vertical coordinate which is a function of pressure and its surface value. A corresponding semi-implicit time scheme is also defined. These schemes am used to compare the usual sigma coordinate with the hybrid coordinate which reduces to pressure above a fixed level and with a modified hybrid coordinate which tends uniformly to pressure at upper levels. Error in the representation of the stratospheric pressure gradient over steep orography can be significantly reduced by use of the hybrid coordinate but the semi-implicit scheme is less stable. The modified hybrid coordinate offers a useful compromise.},

  Abstract                 = {Although well-recognized within the photochemical modeling community, the effect of uncertainties in meteorological input on the urban airshed model (UAM) output has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, the UAM has been applied to investigate the sensitivity of ozone predictions to the choices in wind fields and mixing height profiles for the data-sparse New York metropolitan area. A set of three wind fields, in combination with spatially varying and spatially invariant mixing heights, is investigated for the July 1988 ozone episode. In general, model-predicted ozone levels were higher under the spatially varying mixing height (SVM) option than under the spatially invariant mixing height (SIM) option. SVM-based UAM simulations provided better agreement between the predicted and measured ozone concentrations than SIM-based UAM simulations. However, from the regulatory standpoint, predicted ozone concentrations based on either of these mixing height options are within the range considered as acceptable. UAM simulations with emission reductions of 75\% NOx and 25\% VOCs (NOx-focused) reveal that the improvement in peak ozone levels under the SIM option is larger than that under the SVM option, whereas the emission reduction scenario of 25\% NOx and 75\% YOCs (VOC-focused) yields greater improvement in peak ozone under the SVM option than with the SIM option. Given the strong influence of mixing heights and wind fields on UAM model predictions in data-sparse areas, it is imperative that uncertainties in development of ozone abatement plans be quantified.

Here we show that this acted to slow the rate of increase in global surface temperature over 2000–2009 by about 25% compared to that which would have occurred due only to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. More limited data suggest that stratospheric water vapor probably increased between 1980 and 2000, which would have enhanced the decadal rate of surface warming during the 1990s by about 30% as compared to estimates neglecting this change. These findings show that stratospheric water vapor is an important driver of decadal global surface climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {Ozone plays a very important role in our atmosphere because it protects any living organisms at the Earth's surface against the harmful solar UVB and UVC radiation. In the stratosphere, ozone plays a critical role in the energy budget because it absorbs both solar UV and terrestrial IR radiation. Further, ozone in the tropopause acts as a strong greenhouse gas, and increasing ozone trends at these altitudes contribute to climate change. This review contains a short description of the various techniques that provided atmospheric ozone measurements valuable for long-term trend analysis. The anthropogenic emissions of substances that deplete ozone (chlorine- and bromine-containing volatile gases) have increased from the 1950s until the second half of the 1980s. The most severe consequence of the anthropogenic release of ozone-depleting substances is the "Antarctic ozone hole." Long-term observations indicate that stratospheric ozone depletion in the southern winter-spring season over Antarctica started in the late 1970s, leading to a strong decrease in October total ozone means. Present values are only approximately half of those observed prior to 1970. In the Arctic, large ozone depletion was observed in winter and spring in some recent years. Satellite and ground-based measurements show no significant trends in the tropics but significant long-term decreasing trends in the northern and southern midlatitudes (of the order of 2-4% per decade in the period from 1970 to 1996 and an acceleration in trends in the 1980s). Ozone at northern midlatitudes decreased by -7.4 +/- 2% per decade at 40 km above mean sea level, while ozone loss was small at 30 km. Large trends were found in the lower stratosphere, -5.1 +/- 1.8% at 20 km and -7.3 +/- 4.6% at 15 km, where the bulk of the ozone resides. The possibility of a reduction in the observed trends has been discussed recently, but it is very hard to distinguish this from the natural variability. As a consequence of the Montreal Protocol process, the emissions of ozone-depleting substances have decreased since the late 1980s. Chlorine is no longer increasing in the stratosphere, although the total bromine amount is still increasing. Considering anthropogenic emissions of substances that deplete ozone, the turnaround in stratospheric ozone trends is expected to take place in the coming years. However, anthropogenic climate change could have a large influence on the future evolution of the Earth's ozone shield.},

  Abstract                 = {ECHAM6, the sixth generation of the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM, is described. Major changes with respect to its predecessor affect the representation of shortwave radiative transfer, the height of the model top. Minor changes have been made to model tuning and convective triggering. Several model configurations, differing in horizontal and vertical resolution, are compared. As horizontal resolution is increased beyond T63, the simulated climate improves but changes are incremental; major biases appear to be limited by the parameterization of small-scale physical processes, such as clouds and convection. Higher vertical resolution in the middle atmosphere leads to a systematic reduction in temperature biases in the upper troposphere, and a better representation of the middle atmosphere and its modes of variability. ECHAM6 represents the present climate as well as, or better than, its predecessor. The most marked improvements are evident in the circulation of the extratropics. ECHAM6 continues to have a good representation of tropical variability. A number of biases, however, remain. These include a poor representation of low-level clouds, systematic shifts in major precipitation features, biases in the partitioning of precipitation between land and sea (particularly in the tropics), and midlatitude jets that appear to be insufficiently poleward. The response of ECHAM6 to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is similar to that of ECHAM5. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the mixed-resolution (T63L95) configuration is between 2.9 and 3.4 K and is somewhat larger for the 47 level model. Cloud feedbacks and adjustments contribute positively to warming from increasing greenhouse gases.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. The aerosol-climate modelling system ECHAM5-HAM is introduced. It is based on a flexible microphysical approach and, as the number of externally imposed parameters is minimised, allows the application in a wide range of climate regimes. ECHAM5-HAM predicts the evolution of an ensemble of microphysically interacting internally- and externally-mixed aerosol populations as well as their sizedistribution and composition. The size-distribution is represented by a superposition of log-normal modes. In the current setup, the major global aerosol compounds sulfate (SU), black carbon (BC), particulate organic matter (POM), sea salt (SS), and mineral dust (DU) are included. The simulated global annual mean aerosol burdens (lifetimes) for the year 2000 are for SU: 0.80 Tg(S) (3.9 days), for BC: 0.11 Tg (5.4 days), for POM: 0.99 Tg (5.4 days), for SS: 10.5 Tg (0.8 days), and for DU: 8.28 Tg (4.6 days). An extensive evaluation with in-situ and remote sensing measurements underscores that the model results are generally in good agreement with observations of the global aerosol system. The simulated global annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) is with 0.14 in excellent agreement with an estimate derived from AERONET measurements (0.14) and a composite derived from MODIS-MISR satellite retrievals (0.16). Regionally, the deviations are not negligible. However, the main patterns of AOD attributable to anthropogenic activity are reproduced.},

  Abstract                 = {We have used a three-dimensional off-line chemical transport model (CTM) to assess the impact of lightning emissions in the free troposphere both on NOx itself and on other chemical species such as O3 and OH. We have investigated these effects using two lightning emission scenarios. In the first, lightning emissions are coupled in space and time to the convective cloud top height calculated every 6 h by the CTM's moist convection scheme. In the second, lightning emissions are calculated as a constant, monthly mean field. The model's performance against observed profiles of NOx and O3 in the Atlantic and Pacific ocean improves significantly when lightning emissions are included. With the inclusion of these emissions, the CTM produces a significant increase in the NOx concentrations in the upper troposphere, where the NOx lifetime is long, and a smaller increase in the lower free troposphere, where the surface NOx sources dominate. These changes cause a significant increase in the O3 production in the upper troposphere and hence higher calculated O3 there. The model indicates that lightning emissions cause local increases of over 50 parts per 1012 by volume (pptv) in NOx, 200 pptv in HNO3 and 20 parts per 109 by volume (ppbv) (>40%) in O3. In addition, a smaller increase of O3 in the lower troposphere occurs due to an increase in the downward transport of O3. The O3 change is accompanied by an increase in OH which is more pronounced in the upper troposphere with a corresponding reduction in CO. The method of emission employed in the model does not appear to have a significant effect globally. In the upper troposphere (above about 300 hPa) NOx concentrations are generally lower with monthly mean emissions, because of the de-coupling of emissions from the model's convection scheme, which vents NOx aloft more efficiently in the coupled scheme. Below the local convective outflow altitude, NOx concentrations are larger when using the monthly mean emissions than when coupled to the convection scheme, because the more dilute emissions, and nighttime emissions, lead to a slower NOx destruction rate. Only minor changes are predicted in the monthly average fields of O3 if we emit lightning as a monthly constant field. However, the method of emission becomes important when we make a direct comparison of model results with time varying data. These differences should be taken into account when a direct comparison of O3 with measurements collected at particular times and locations is attempted.},

In the first step, the compounds are condensed into a manageable number of emission categories which could be adapted to a variety of molecularly-based lumped chemical mechanisms. In the second step, the emissions are further aggregated into a smaller set of VOC classes which directly correspond to those in a particular model's mechanism. The application of this procedure is illustrated by aggregating the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) anthropogenic VOC emissions inventory the U.S. first into the 32-class system, and then into the groups of model species used in the latest version of the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2.0). The importance of different VOC categories and source types on regional pollution production is explored by comparing the contributions of each of the emissions groupings, RADM model species, and major emissions sources, to total moles carbon VOC reacted in model simulations. For this particular anthropogenic inventory and chemical mechanism, it is found that over 50% of the moles carbon reacted is associated with mobile sources. Such analysis can help indicate which uncertainties in anthropogenic emissions inventories may have the greatest impact on results of regional simulations. ER -},

  Abstract                 = {Climate impacts and adaptation research increasingly uses ensembles of regional and local climate change scenarios. To do so, the ensembles are examined to evaluate whether they describe a systematic difference between present states (and impacts) and envisaged future states—and such differences are often characterized as being statistically significant. This term “significance” is well defined by statistical terminology as the result of a test of a null hypothesis that is applied to samples of observations that are obtained with a defined sampling strategy. However such a statistical null hypothesis may not be a well-posed problem in the context of the evaluation of climate change scenarios. Therefore, the usage of terms such “statistically significant scenario” may be misunderstood in the general discourse about the certainty of projected climate change. We propose to employ instead a simple descriptive approach for characterizing the information in an ensemble of scenarios. Physical plausibility in the light of theoretical reasoning often adds robustness to the interpretation of climate change scenarios.},

From knowledge of the relative contributions of greenhouse gases and other forcings to observed temperature change it is possible to infer the likely rates of future warming, consistent with past observed temperature changes. Probabilistic forecasts of future warming rates in six continental-scale regions have been calculated by assuming that there is a linear relationship between past and future fractional error in temperature change on these spatial scales. All regions are expected to warm over the next century with the largest uncertainty in future warming rates being in North America and Europe. More tightly constrained predictions are obtained if it is assumed that fractional errors in global mean temperature change scale the regional projections.},

  Abstract                 = {The first results of a regional circulation model REMOiso fitted with water isotope diagnostics are compared with various isotope series from central Europe. A 2 year case study is conducted from March 1997 to February 1999 centred over Europe, analysing daily and monthly measurements. Isotope signals over Europe are dominated by the typical isotopic effects such as temperature, continental and altitude effects, both on annual and seasonal scales. These well-known isotopic effects are successfully reproduced by REMOiso, using two different boundary data sets. In a first simulation, the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses serve as boundary conditions, where water isotopes were parameterized by a simple temperature dependence. In a second simulation, boundary conditions both for climatic and isotopic variables are taken from the ECHAM(iso) general circulation model output. The comparison of both simulations shows a very high sensitivity of the simulated delta(18)O signal to boundary conditions. The ECMWF-nested simulation shows an average offset of -4.5% in mean delta(18)O values and exaggerated seasonal amplitude. The ECHAM-nested simulation represents correctly the observed mean delta(18)O values, although with a dampened seasonality. REMOiso isotope module is further validated against daily delta(18)O measurements at selected stations (Nordeney, Arkona and Hohenpeissenberg) situated in Germany.

  Abstract                 = {We discuss a method to obtain the spatial estimates of rainfall on the Indian west coast for calculating the surface water budget. The region includes the basin of the Mandovi River, a typical west-coast river whose catchment area includes the Sahyadris range. The rainfall maps obtained by a multivariate interpolation scheme, with elevation as the third variable, were able to capture the sharp increase in rainfall on the windward slopes and the exponential decay in rainfall on the leeward side. The rainfall maps were used to force a hydrological model and the simulated discharge was within 16% of the observed discharge in 16 of 18 years during 1981-1998; the average error over the 18 years was 8%, which is much less than the estimated error of sim15-20% in the observed discharge. The Mandovi river discharge provided a reliable and independent validation of the accuracy of the rainfall estimate as the river is purely rain-fed. The method provides a better estimate of rainfall in the Mandovi basin, and therefore for the Indian west coast, than existing rainfall datasets. The key result is that treating the windward and leeward sides separately by an a priori, subjective extraction of the ridge line can reduce the underestimation of rainfall that is common in mountainous terrain when the data coverage is sparse.

  Abstract                 = {Biomass burning is an important source of greenhouse gases and of ozone precursors such as CO. Recent analyses combining the use of satellite data and of ecosystem models showed that wild fire emissions are subject to a large interannual variability. In this study, NOAA/ESRL CO surface measurements are used in conjunction with the results from the LMDz-INCA global chemistry-transport model and analyzed over the 1997â2001 period in order to quantify the relative contributions of biomass burning emissions and of climate to the CO interannual variability (IAV). Over the considered five year period, the mean CO IAV was found to be about 11% for stations far from regional pollution and 4.5% for Antarctic stations. At both southern and northern high latitude stations, the CO IAV is controlled almost equally by variations in biomass burning emissions and atmospheric meteorology. On the contrary, meteorological variability prevails in the tropics, where it explains 50% to 90% of the CO IAV. Variability in long-range transport and climate is thus the dominant process controlling the CO interannual variability, except during specific episodes, such as the intense fires associated with the 1997â1998 El NiÃ±o event.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Ozone variations with seasonal and intraseasonal timescales in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) are investigated using a 5-year tropical ozonesonde data set from the SHADOZ ( Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes) archive. The longitudinal ozone distribution in the tropical upper troposphere (TUT) shows a zonal wave one structure with maxima around the Atlantic and Africa and minima around the western Pacific throughout the year, while the annual variation shows maxima during northern summer to autumn at most longitudes. We compare the ozone distribution with the vertical temperature structure and found that the lapse rate is gradual ( steep) at the ozone-enhanced ( reduced) longitude and season. The east-west temperature structure and ozone variation in the TUT may be explained by the longitudinal variation of the large-scale atmospheric responses to the tropical heat source, which could govern both the temperature structure and the vertical transport processes. Ozone variability in the TUT is also large around the Atlantic and Africa and small around the western Pacific. However, the zonal wave one structure is not clear in the temperature variability and in the correlation coefficient between ozone and temperature, which can be related with wave activities around the tropopause. Remarkably large ozone variabilities with good correlation are observed in Africa during summer and in the central Pacific during autumn-winter. These are associated with large-scale equatorial waves, but the longitudinal variation of the wave activities does not seem to be an important factor in the zonal wave one structure of ozone.},

  Abstract                 = {The chemical characteristics of air parcels over the tropical South Atlantic during September - October 1992 are summarized by analysis of aged marine and continental outflow classifications. Positive correlations between CO and CH3Cl and minimal enhancements of C2Cl4 and various chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) species in air parcels recently advected over the South Atlantic basin strongly suggest an impact on tropospheric chemistry from biomass burning on adjacent continental areas of Brazil and Africa. Comparison of the composition of aged Pacific air with aged marine air over the South Atlantic basin from 0.3 to 12.5 km altitude indicates potential accumulation of long-lived species during the local dry season. This may amount to enhancements of up to two-fold for C2H6, 30% for CO, and 10% for CH3Cl. Nitric oxide and NOx were significantly enhanced (up to similar to 1 part per billion by volume (ppbv)) above 10 km altitude and poorly correlated with CO and CH3Cl. In addition, median mixing ratios of NO and NOx were essentially identical in aged marine and continental outflow air masses. It appears that in addition to biomass burning, lightning or recycled reactive nitrogen may be an important source of NOx to the upper troposphere. Methane exhibited a monotonic increase with altitude from similar to 1690 to 1720 ppbv in both aged marine and continental outflow air masses. The largest mixing ratios in the upper troposphere were often anticorrelated with CO, CH3Cl, and CO2, suggesting CH4 contributions from natural sources. We also argue, based on CH4/CO ratios and relationships with various hydrocarbon and CFC species, that inputs from biomass burning and the northern hemisphere are unlikely to be the dominant sources of CO, CH4, and C2H6 in aged marine air. Emissions from urban areas would seem to be necessary to account for the distribution of at least CH4 and C2H6. Over the African and South American continents an efficient mechanism of convective vertical transport coupled with large-scale circulations conveys biomass burning, urban, and natural emissions to the upper troposphere over the South Atlantic basin. Slow subsidence over the eastern South Atlantic basin may play an important role in establishing and maintaining the rather uniform vertical distribution of long-lived species over this region. The common occurrence of values greater than 1 for the ratio CH3OOH/H2O2 in the upper troposphere suggests that precipitation scavenging effectively removed highly water soluble gases (H2O2, HNO3, HCOOH, and CH3COOH) and aerosols during vertical convective transport over the continents. However, horizontal injection of biomass burning products over the South Atlantic, particularly water soluble species and aerosol particles, was frequent below 6 km altitude.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] During July and August, 2004, balloon-borne ozonesondes were released daily at 12 sites in the eastern USA and Canada, producing the largest single set of free tropospheric ozone measurements ever compiled for this region. At the same time, a number of air quality forecast models were run daily as part of a larger field experiment. In this paper, we compare these ozonesonde profiles with predicted ozone profiles from several versions of two of these forecast models, the Environment Canada CHRONOS and AURAMS models. We find that the models show considerable skill at predicting ozone in the planetary boundary layer and immediately above. Individual station biases are variable, but often small. Standard deviations of observation-forecast differences are large, however. Ozone variability in the models is somewhat higher than observed. Most strikingly, none of the model versions is able to reproduce the typical tropospheric ozone profile of increasing mixing ratio with altitude. Results from a sensitivity test suggest that the form of the ozone lateral boundary condition used by all model versions contributes significantly to the large ozone underpredictions in the middle and upper troposphere. The discrepancy could be reduced further by adding a downward flux of ozone from the model lid and by accounting for in situ production of ozone from lightning-generated NOx.},

  Abstract                 = {The regional Eta workstation (WS) model with horizontal resolution of 40 km has been integrated over South America for January 2003. The NCEP-DOE Reanalysis II was used for initial and lateral boundary conditions. The comparison of the model-simulated and satellite-derived values of monthly mean incident solar radiation at the surface demonstrates that the former values are larger by 20%-30% over the entire region. To improve the surface flux representation in the model, a new solar radiation scheme has been implemented in it. An offline comparison of the original and the new radiation schemes with the detailed line-by-line method demonstrates a higher accuracy for the new scheme. With the new scheme, the model-simulated incident solar radiation at the surface is in a better agreement with the satellite-derived data. Nevertheless, a noticeable systematic difference of 10%-20% still remains, probably because of the incorrect description of cloud parameters in the model. The lower incident solar radiation in the new version of the model causes a decrease of near-surface air temperature by 0.1 degrees-1 degrees C and a decrease of precipitation rate by up to 20%-30% over most of the continent. The increase in the simulated incident solar radiation and temperature is found in the region of the South Atlantic convergence zone, which is responsible for the enhanced cloudiness and precipitation in the central and southeastern parts of Brazil during summer. The model results are compared with observational data of meteorological stations, the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), and the South American Low-Level Jet Experiment (SALLJEX) and are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a simple conceptual model to explain that even spherical scatterers lead to a polarization difference signal for microwave limb radiances. The conceptual model relates the polarization difference measured by a limb-looking sensor situated inside a cloud with the anisotropy of the radiation. In the simulations, it was assumed that the cloud consists of spherical ice particles with a radius of 68.5 mu m which were situated between 10.6 and 12.3 km altitude. The frequencies 318 and 500 GHz were considered. The results of the conceptual model were compared to the results of the fully polarized scattering model ARTS-1-1. The comparison showed a good qualitative agreement. The polarization difference decreases inside the cloud with increasing height and changes sign. This behavior can be related to a different amount of radiation coming from the atmosphere above and below the cloud, compared to the amount of radiation coming from the sides.

  Abstract                 = {The principal oxidants in the lower atmosphere are ozone (O3) and two by-products of O3 photodissociation, the hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A number of critical atmospheric chemical problems depend on the earth's ``oxidizing capacity,{''} which is essentially the global burden of these oxidants. There is limited direct evidence for changes in the earth's oxidizing capacity since recent preindustrial times when, because of industrial and population growth, increasing amounts of O3 precursor trace gases (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons) have been released into the atmosphere. The concentrations of O3 and possibly H2O2 have increased over large regions. Models predict that tropospheric O3 will increase approximately 0.3 to 1\% per year over the next 50 years with both positive and negative trends possible for OH and H2O2. Models and the observational network for oxidants are improving, but validation of global models is still at an early stage.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Cloud layers in the troposphere influence photolysis rates (J values) and hence concentrations of chemical species. In order to study the impact of clouds on photolysis rates and oxidants, we have developed a simplified version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR) Tropospheric Ultraviolet-Visible (TUV) model and have coupled the simplified TUV ( otherwise known as the fast TUV (FTUV)) into the NCAR/ Atmospheric Chemistry Division global transport chemical model ( Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART-2)). The FTUV model has the same physical processes as the TUV model, except that the wavelength bins between 121 and 750 nm are reduced from 140 to 17. As a result, FTUV is about 8 times faster than the original TUV. Differences in the calculated photolysis rates between TUV and FTUV are generally less than 5% in the troposphere. Subgrid vertical distributions of clouds are also considered in the calculation of photolysis rates in MOZART-2. The method used in this study is a mixed maximum and random overlap scheme. The subgrid method increases the computation time for photolysis rates by a factor of 3 compared to a simple method in which clouds are uniformly distributed over the MOZART-2 grids. Our calculation shows that the uniform cloud distribution method tends to significantly overestimate back scattering on the top of clouds and overestimates the impact on photochemistry in the troposphere. The results suggest that clouds have important impacts on tropospheric chemistry. Global mean OH concentration increases by about 20% due to the impact of clouds. As a result, the calculated CH4 lifetime changes to 11 years for clear sky and 9 years for cloudy sky. The latter value is closer to the methane lifetime estimated from previous studies. Calculated CO surface concentrations are compared with observed values, showing an improvement when the impact of clouds on the photolysis rates is taken into account. Clouds also have important impacts on tropospheric ozone budget. Our calculation suggest that because of clouds, the globally averaged photolysis rates of J[O-3], J[CH2O], and J[NO2] are enhanced in the troposphere by about 12, 13, and 13%, respectively, leading to an 8% increase in the tropospheric O-3 concentrations. Our study suggests that clouds strongly influence photolysis rates and hence play an important role in controlling the concentrations of the tropospheric oxidants. Such effects should be carefully considered and included in regional and global chemical transport models.},

  Abstract                 = {Extreme cold spells over Northern Europe during winter are examined in order to address the question to what degree and in which ways stratospheric dynamics may influence the state of the troposphere. The study is based on 500 years of a pre-industrial control simulation with a comprehensive global climate model which well resolves the stratosphere, the MPI Earth System Model. Geopotential height anomalies leading to cold air outbreaks leave imprints throughout the atmosphere including the middle and lower stratosphere. A significant connection between tropospheric winter cold spells over Northern Europe and erosion of the stratospheric polar vortex is detected up to 30�hPa. In about 40 percent of the cases, the extreme cold spells are preceded by dynamical disturbances in the stratosphere. The strong warmings associated with the deceleration of the stratospheric jet cause the tropopause height to decrease over high latitudes. The compression of the tropospheric column below favors the development of high pressure anomalies and blocking signatures over polar regions. This in turn leads to the advection of cold air towards Northern Europe and the establishment of a negative annular mode pattern in the troposphere. Anomalies in the residual mean meridional circulation during the stratospheric weak vortex events contribute to the warming of the lower stratosphere, but are not key in the mechanism through which the stratosphere impacts the troposphere.},

  Abstract                 = {A statistical extreme value analysis is applied to very high-resolution climate model results and observations encompassing the area of Germany. Two control runs representing the current climate, as well as three scenario simulations of the regional climate model REMO, are investigated. The control runs were compared against high-resolution observations. The analysis is divided into two main parts: first trends in extreme quantiles of daily precipitation totals are estimated in a station-by-station analysis. In the second part, the spatial characteristics of the estimated trends in heavy rainfall are investigated over the area of Germany by fitting a parametric geostatistical model to these trends. The rule of thumb of estimating trends in extreme quantiles of heavy precipitation based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, about 6.5% per 1Â°C temperature increase, has been roughly confirmed for Germany by our study with respect to the observations, but the climate model computes weaker trends. In the control simulations, the climate model tends to underestimate trends in heavy rainfall compared to observations. In the scenario simulations, positive trends prevail (as in the observations). They are, however, relatively small when set in relation to the uncertainties. The trends become significantly positive to a larger spatial extent only in the A2 scenario simulation. The estimated shape of the extreme value distributions does not change significantly in the scenario simulations compared to the climate model control runs. The parameter estimates for the geostatistical model for the trends in extreme quantiles of daily precipitation sums are rather uncertain. The most striking feature of the analysis is a reduction of the spatial variance of the trends over the considered area of Germany in the scenario simulations compared to observations and, in particular, the climate model control runs.},

  Abstract                 = {This study evaluates the ability of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to simulate the spatial variability of summertime ozone (O-3) at the surface and in the free troposphere over the continental United States. Simulated surface O-3 concentrations are compared with 987 Air Quality System (AQS) sites and 123 Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) sites. CMAQ's ability to reproduce surface observations varies with O-3 concentration. The model best simulates observed O-3 for intermediate concentrations (40-60 ppbv), while over-(under-) predicting at lower (higher) levels. CMAQ reproduces surface O-3 for a wide range of conditions (30-80 ppbv) with a normalized mean error (NME) less than 35% and normalized mean bias (NMB) lying between +/- 15% for the whole domain. Although systematically over-predicting O-3 in the east and under-predicting it in the western United States, CMAQ is able to reproduce 1- and 8-h daily maxima with a cross-domain mean bias (MB) of 1 and 8 ppbv, or NMB of 8% and 25%, respectively. The model underestimates observed O-3 at rural sites (MB = -5 ppbv, NMB = -5% and NME = 23% with a 40 ppbv cut-off value) and over-predicts it at urban and suburban sites by a similar magnitude (MB = 6 ppbv, NMB = 7% and NME = 25%). Apparent errors and biases decrease when data is averaged over longer periods, suggesting that most evaluation statistics are dependent on the time scale of data aggregation. Therefore, performance criteria should specify an averaging period (e.g., 1- or 8-h) and not be independent of averaging period as some current model evaluation studies imply. Comparisons of vertical profiles of simulated O-3 with ozonesonde data show both overestimation and underestimation by 10-20 ppbv in the lower troposphere and a consistent under-prediction in the upper troposphere. Vertical O-3 distributions are better simulated when lateral boundary conditions obtained from the global Model of Ozone and Related Tracers version 2 (MOZART-2) are used, but under-prediction remains. The assumption of zero-flux at the top boundary and the resulting exclusion of the contribution of stratosphere-troposphere exchange to tropospheric O-3 concentrations limit the ability of CMAQ to reproduce O-3 concentrations in the upper troposphere.

We calculate O-3 impacts using a new integrated assessment model that links pollution emissions to their chemical transformation, transport, population exposures, and effects on human health. We find that increased NOx emissions in rural areas around Atlanta increase human exposure to ambient O-3 twice as much as suburban emissions. However, increased NOx emissions in central city Atlanta actually reduce O-3 exposures. For downtown emissions, the reduction in human exposures to O-3 from titration by NO in the central city outweighs the effects from increased downwind O-3. The results indicate that the marginal damage from NOx emissions varies greatly across a metropolitan area. The results raise concerns if cap and trade regulations cause emissions to migrate toward higher marginal damage locations.},

  Abstract                 = {In global models of the atmosphere convection is parameterised, since the typical scale of this process is smaller than the model resolution. Here we address some of the uncertainties arising from the selection of different algorithms to simulate this process. Four different parameterisations for atmospheric convection, all used in state-of-the-art models, are implemented in the model system ECHAM5/MESSy for a consistent inter-comparison and evaluation against observations. Relatively large differences are found in the simulated precipitation patterns, whereas simulated water vapour columns distributions are quite similar and close to observations. The effects on the hydrological cycle and on the simulated meteorological conditions are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {During the summer of 1988, measurements of photochemical trace species were made at a coordinated network of seven rural sites in the eastern United States and Canada. At six of these sites concurrent measurements of ozone and the sum of the reactive nitrogen species, NOy, were made, and at four of the sites a measure for the reaction products of the NOx oxidation was obtained. Common to all sites, ozone, in photochemically aged air during the summer, shows an increase with increasing NOy levels, from a background value of 30â40 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) at NOy mixing ratios below 1 ppbv to values between 70 to 100 ppbv at NOy levels of 10 ppbv. Ozone correlates even more closely with the products of the NOx oxidation. The correlations from the different sites agree closely at mixing ratios of the oxidation products below 5 ppbv, but systematic differences appear at higher levels. Variations in the biogenic hydrocarbon emissions may explain these differences.},

  Abstract                 = {An update is provided on the Earth&#39;s global annual mean energy budget in the light of new observations and analyses. In 1997, Kiehl and Trenberth provided a review of past estimates and performed a number of radiative computations to better establish the role of clouds and various greenhouse gases in the overall radiative energy flows, with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) values constrained by Earth Radiation Budget Experiment values from 1985 to 1989, when the TOA values were approximately in balance. The Clouds and the Earth&#39;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) measurements from March 2000 to May 2004 are used at TOA but adjusted to an estimated imbalance from the enhanced greenhouse effect of 0.9 W m&#8722;2. Revised estimates of surface turbulent fluxes are made based on various sources. The partitioning of solar radiation in the atmosphere is based in part on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) FD computations that utilize the global ISCCP cloud data every 3 h, and also accounts for increased atmospheric absorption by water vapor and aerosols.Surface upward longwave radiation is adjusted to account for spatial and temporal variability. A lack of closure in the energy balance at the surface is accommodated by making modest changes to surface fluxes, with the downward longwave radiation as the main residual to ensure a balance.Values are also presented for the land and ocean domains that include a net transport of energy from ocean to land of 2.2 petawatts (PW) of which 3.2 PW is from moisture (latent energy) transport, while net dry static energy transport is from land to ocean. Evaluations of atmospheric re-analyses reveal substantial biases.},

  Abstract                 = {ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Mediumw-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the Southern hemisphere in the 1970s. particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast. the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations that the 'second-generation' ERA-40 re-analysis would provide products that are better than those from the first generation ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability of a large ensemble of regional climate models to accurately simulate heat waves at the regional scale of Europe was evaluated. Within the EURO-CORDEX project, several state-of-the art models, including non-hydrostatic meso-scale models, were run for an extended time period (20 years) at high resolution (12 km), over a large domain allowing for the first time the simultaneous representation of atmospheric phenomena over a large range of spatial scales. Eight models were run in this configuration, and thirteen models were run at a classical resolution of 50 km. The models were driven with the same boundary conditions, the ERA-Interim re-analysis, and except for one simulation, no observations were assimilated in the inner domain. Results, which are compared with daily temperature and precipitation observations (ECA&D and E-OBS data sets) show that, even forced by the same re-analysis, the ensemble exhibits a large spread. A preliminary analysis of the sources of spread, using in particular simulations of the same model with different parameterizations, shows that the simulation of hot temperature is primarily sensitive to the convection and the microphysics schemes, which affect incoming energy and the Bowen ratio. Further, most models exhibit an overestimation of summertime temperature extremes in Mediterranean regions and an underestimation over Scandinavia. Even after bias removal, the simulated heat wave events were found to be too persistent, but a higher resolution reduced this deficiency. The amplitude of events as well as the variability beyond the 90th percentile threshold were found to be too strong in almost all simulations and increasing resolution did not generally improve this deficiency. Resolution increase was also shown to induce large-scale 90th percentile warming or cooling for some models, with beneficial or detrimental effects on the overall biases. Even though full causality cannot be established on the basis of this evaluation work, the drivers of such regional differences were shown to be linked to changes in precipitation due to resolution changes, affecting the energy partitioning. Finally, the inter-annual sequence of hot summers over central/southern Europe was found to be fairly well simulated in most experiments despite an overestimation of the number of hot days and of the variability. The accurate simulation of inter-annual variability for a few models is independent of the model bias. This indicates that internal variability of high summer temperatures should not play a major role in controlling inter-annual variability. Despite some improvements, especially along coastlines, the analyses conducted here did not allow us to generally conclude that a higher resolution is clearly beneficial for a correct representation of heat waves by regional climate models. Even though local-scale feedbacks should be better represented at high resolution, combinations of parameterizations have to be improved or adapted accordingly.},

  Abstract                 = {A global warming of 2 °C relative to pre-industrial climate has been considered as a threshold which society should endeavor to remain below, in order to limit the dangerous effects of anthropogenic climate change. The possible changes in regional climate under this target level of global warming have so far not been investigated in detail. Using an ensemble of 15 regional climate simulations downscaling six transient global climate simulations, we identify the respective time periods corresponding to 2 °C global warming, describe the range of projected changes for the European climate for this level of global warming, and investigate the uncertainty across the multi-model ensemble. Robust changes in mean and extreme temperature, precipitation, winds and surface energy budgets are found based on the ensemble of simulations. The results indicate that most of Europe will experience higher warming than the global average. They also reveal strong distributional patterns across Europe, which will be important in subsequent impact assessments and adaptation responses in different countries and regions. For instance, a North–South (West–East) warming gradient is found for summer (winter) along with a general increase in heavy precipitation and summer extreme temperatures. Tying the ensemble analysis to time periods with a prescribed global temperature change rather than fixed time periods allows for the identification of more robust regional patterns of temperature changes due to removal of some of the uncertainty related to the global models’ climate sensitivity.},

The relatively small SALLJ spatial scale (compared with the density of the available sounding network) has a limited understanding of and modeling capability for any variations in the SALLJ intensity and structure as well as its possible relationship to downstream rainfall.

  Abstract                 = {An important goal of the Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) research on the American monsoon systems is to determine the sources and limits of predictability of warm season precipitation, with emphasis on weekly to interannual time scales. This paper reviews recent progress in the understanding of the American monsoon systems and identifies some of the future challenges that remain to improve warm season climate prediction. Much of the recent progress is derived from complementary international programs in North and South America, namely, the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) and the Monsoon Experiment South America (MESA), with the following common objectives: 1) to understand the key components of the American monsoon systems and their variability, 2) to determine the role of these systems in the global water cycle, 3) to improve observational datasets, and 4) to improve simulation and monthly-to-seasonal prediction of the monsoons and regional water resources. Among the recent observational advances highlighted in this paper are new insights into moisture transport processes, description of the structure and variability of the South American low-level jet, and resolution of the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the core monsoon regions. NAME and MESA are also driving major efforts in model development and hydrologic applications. Incorporated into the postfield phases of these projects are assessments of atmosphere-land surface interactions and model-based climate predictability experiments. As CLIVAR research on American monsoon systems evolves, a unified view of the climatic processes modulating continental warm season precipitation is beginning to emerge.},

  Abstract                 = {Southern Hemisphere (SH) circulation conditions during austral springs of ENSO events are examined. Based on previous knowledge that SST variations over the subtropical south-central Pacific (SSCP) region are linked to differences among El Nino (EN) events, a stratification of the springs associated with EN events was performed according to SST conditions over the El Nino-3.4 sector and over the SSCP region. The EN events associated with cold conditions in the SSCP (WC) exhibit enhanced convection not only in the intertropical convergence zone over the central equatorial Pacific but also in the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) extended southeastward into the subtropical regions. The resulting heating forcing intensifies a localized overturning cell, which is associated with an anomalous Rossby wave source in the central South Pacific extratropical region. Neither the Rossby wave source nor the associated wave pattern is evident during EN events associated with warm conditions in the SSCP and inactive SPCZ (WW). The basic features that characterize the differences in the EN response over the South Pacific can also be identified through the analysis of the SPCZ activity over the central South Pacific. The fact that variations in SPCZ activity lead SST anomaly changes in the SSCP would indicate that the differences in the EN response over the SH might be mainly driven by atmospheric changes, which induces extratropical SST anomalies. The differences in the circulation anomalies that characterize both types of EN response over the SH were further explored through the analysis of the activity of the three leading modes of circulation variability. The combined effect of the three leading patterns describes in some extent the intensification (weakening) of the cyclonic circulation anomaly observed over the southeastern Pacific in WC (WW), associated with an active (inactive) SPCZ. In particular, the interdecadal variability observed in the Pacific by many previous studies influences the circulation response to ENSO over the SH, mainly through changes in the activity of the SH annular mode.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] An aerosol model (M7) designed to be coupled to general circulation models (GCM) and chemistry transport models (CTM) is described. In M7 the aerosol population is divided into two types of particles: mixed, or water-soluble particles, and insoluble particles. The particles are represented by seven classes, using a "pseudomodal'' approach. Four classes are for the mixed particles representing nucleation, Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode, and three are for the insoluble ( Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode). The components considered are mineral dust, black carbon ( BC) and primary organic carbon (OC), sulfate, and sea salt. The aerosol dynamic processes in M7 include nucleation, coagulation, and condensation of sulfuric acid. Mixed particles are formed from insoluble particles by coagulation and condensation. The integration scheme is computationally very efficient. The model has been tested against the analytical solution and a sectional model for the formation of SO4/BC mixed particles, evaluating the mixing by condensation and coagulation. Furthermore, M7 has been run in free tropospheric conditions and compared to aircraft observations. M7 has proven to be accurate and fast enough to be included in a GCM or CTM.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional climate modeling using regional climate models (RCMs) has matured over the past decade to enable meaningful utilization in a broad spectrum of applications. In this paper, the latest progress in regional climate modeling studies is reviewed, including RCM development, applications of RCMs to dynamical downscaling for climate change assessment and seasonal climate predictions, climate process studies, and the study of regional climate predictability. Challenges and potential directions of future research in this important area are discussed, with focus on those that have received less attention previously, such as the importance of ensemble simulations, further development and improvement of the regional climate modeling approach, modeling extreme climate events and sub-daily variation of clouds and precipitation, model evaluation and diagnostics, applications of RCMs to climate process studies and seasonal predictions, and development of regional earth system models. It is believed that with the demonstrated credibility of RCMs in reproducing not only monthly to seasonal mean climate and interannual variability, but also the extreme climate events when driven by good quality reanalysis and continuous improvements in the skill of global general circulation models (GCMs) in simulating large-scale atmospheric circulation, regional climate modeling will remain an important dynamical downscaling tool for providing the needed information for assessing climate change impacts, and seasonal climate predictions, and a powerful tool for improving our understanding of regional climate processes. Internationally coordinated efforts can be developed to further advance regional climate modeling studies. It is also recognized that since the final quality of the results from nested RCMs depends in part on the realism of the large-scale forcing provided by GCMs, the reduction of errors and improvement in physics parameterizations in both GCMs and RCMs remain a priority for the climate modeling community.},

  Abstract                 = {Satellite CO measurements from Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) were used in the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment-North America (INTEX-A) by the flight planning team to monitor local emissions and the transport of polluted air masses. Because simultaneous measurements of tropospheric CO from both AIRS and MOPITT were used by different investigators during this experiment, a cross reference and comparison are necessary to understand these two data sets and their impacts to the scientific conclusions developed from them. The global CO mixing ratios at 500 mbar, as well as the CO total column amount, are compared between the two instruments for both direct comparison and the comparison using the same a priori profile for the period from 15 June to 14 August 2004. Also presented are the comparisons of the remotely sensed profiles by AIRS, MOPITT, and the in situ profiles collected by the DACOM. In summary, both sensors agree very well on the horizontal distributions of CO represented by the high correlation coefficients (0.7-0.98), and they agree on the CO concentrations to within an average of 10-15 ppbv. Over land, the CO variability is higher, and the correlations between the two data sets are relatively lower than over ocean; however, there is no evidence of a systematic bias. Over the oceans where the CO concentration is smaller in the lower atmosphere, AIRS-MOPITT show a positive bias of 15-20 ppbv and the details are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument, which was launched aboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra spacecraft on 18 December 1999, is designed to; measure tropospheric CO and CH4 by use of a nadir-viewing geometry. The measurements are taken at 4.7 mum in the thermal emission and absorption for the CO mixing ratio profile retrieval and at 2.3 and 2.2 mum in the reflected solar region for the total CO column amount and CH4 column amount retrieval, respectively. To achieve the required measurement accuracy, it is critical to identify and remove cloud contamination in the radiometric signals. We describe an algorithm to detect cloudy pixels, to reconstruct clear column radiance for pixels with partial cloud covers, and to estimate equivalent cloud top height for overcast conditions to allow CO profile retrievals above clouds. The MOPITT channel radiances, as well as the first-guess calculations, are simulated with a fast forward model with input atmospheric profiles from ancillary data sets. The precision of the retrieved CO profiles and total column amounts in cloudy atmospheres is within the expected +/-10% range. Validations of the cloud-detecting thresholds with the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer airborne simulator data and MOPITT airborne test radiometer measurements were performed. The validation results showed that the MOPITT cloud detection thresholds work well for scenes covered with more than 5-10% cloud cover if the uncertainties in the model input profiles are less than 2 K for temperature, 10% for water vapor, and 5% for CO and CH4.

Vulnerabilities and risk potential are discussed using the examples of Mexico City and Mumbai. We present the experience accumulated in the 6&nbsp;years work of the Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative (EMI, http://www-megacities.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/) with more than 20 large cities around the world, mostly located in the developing world. On this background we analyze obstacles that keep megacities from developing an efficient approach towards disaster mitigation and define a strategy that might overcome these problems. The key element of this strategy is the development of a Disaster Risk Management Master Plan (DRMMP) for cities. Currently the Istanbul Earthquake Master Plan (IEMP) serves as best example for an appropriate strategy for disaster reduction in megacities.},

  Abstract                 = {Global carbon emissions from fires are difficult to quantify and have the potential to influence interannual variability and long-term trends in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We used 4 years of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) satellite data and a biogeochemical model to assess spatial and temporal variability of carbon emissions from tropical fires. The TRMM satellite data extended between 38degreesN and 38degreesS and covered the period from 1998 to 2001. A relationship between TRMM fire counts and burned area was derived using estimates of burned area from other satellite fire products in Africa and Australia and reported burned areas from the United States. We modified the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model to account for both direct combustion losses and the decomposition from fire-induced mortality, using both TRMM and Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite data as model drivers. Over the 1998-2001 period, we estimated that the sum of carbon emissions from tropical fires and fuel wood use was 2.6 Pg C yr(-1). An additional flux of 1.2 Pg C yr(-1) was released indirectly, as a result of decomposition of vegetation killed by fire but not combusted. The sum of direct and indirect carbon losses from fires represented 9% of tropical and subtropical net primary production (NPP). We found that including fire processes in the tropics substantially alters the seasonal cycle of net biome production by shifting carbon losses to months with low soil moisture and low rates of soil microbial respiration.

The key improvement is the computation of bulk surface resistances along three distinct pathways of mass transfer to sites of deposition at the upper portions of vegetative canopies or structures, the lower portions, and the ground (or water surface). This approach replaces the previous technique of providing simple look-up tables of bulk surface resistances. With the surface resistances divided explicitly into distinct pathways, the bulk surface resistances for a large number of gases in addition to those usually addressed in acid deposition models (SO2,O3, NOx and HNO3) can be computed, if estimates of the effective Henry's Law constants and appropriate measures of the chemical reactivity of the various substances are known. This has been accomplished successfully for H2O2, HCHO, CH3CHO (to represent other aldehydes), CH3O2H (to represent organic peroxides), CH3C(O)O2H, HCOOH (to represent organic acids), NH3, CH3C(O)O2NO2 and HNO2. Other factors considered include surface temperature, stomatal response to environmental parameters, the wetting of surfaces by dew and rain, and the covering of surfaces by snow. Surface emission of gases and variations of uptake characteristics by individual plant species within the landuse types are not considered explicitly.},

We use daily surface ozone concentrations from a global atmospheric transport and chemistry model, and ozone-mortality relationships from daily time-series studies. The population-weighted annual average 8-h daily maximum ozone is projected to increase, relative to the present, in each of ten world regions under the SRES A2 scenario and the current legislation (CLE) scenario, with the largest growth in tropical regions, while decreases are projected in each region in the maximum feasible reduction (MFR) scenario. Emission reductions in the CLE scenario, relative to A2, are estimated to reduce about 190,000 premature human mortalities globally in 2030, with the most avoided mortalities in Africa. The MFR scenario will avoid about 460,000 premature mortalities relative to A2 in 2030, and 270,000 relative to CLE, with the greatest reductions in South Asia.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a formal method of species lumping that can be applied automatically to intermediate compounds within detailed and complex tropospheric chemical reaction schemes. The method is based on grouping species with reference to their chemical lifetimes and reactivity structures. A method for determining the forward and reverse transformations between individual and lumped compounds is developed. Preliminary application to the Leeds Master Chemical Mechanism (MCMv2.0) has led to the removal of 734 species and 1777 reactions from the scheme, with minimal degradation of accuracy across a wide range of test trajectories relevant to polluted tropospheric conditions. The lumped groups are seen to relate to groups of peroxy acyl nitrates, nitrates, carbonates, oxepins, substituted phenols, oxeacids and peracids with similar lifetimes and reaction rates with OH. In combination with other reduction techniques, such as sensitivity analysis and the application of the quasi-steady state approximation (QSSA), a reduced mechanism has been developed that contains 35% of the number of species and 40% of the number of reactions compared to the full mechanism. This has led to a speed up of a factor of 8 in terms of computer calculation time within box model simulations.},

In this study, the measured summertime averaged CO concentrations north of 30 degrees N were correlated with area burned by forest fires in North America and Russia. According to a linear regression analysis, 14% of the CO variability in the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere can be explained by boreal forest area burnt in North America, 53% by area burnt in Russia, and 63% by the combination of both. There are strong indications that the officially reported Russian fire areas are significantly underestimated. By statistically correcting these areas, we can show that, on the average, boreal burning provides a summertime CO source term comparable with all anthropogenic sources in the United States and Europe. },

  Abstract                 = {A consistent daily bias correction procedure was applied at 4802 stations over high latitude regions (North of 45�N) to quantify the precipitation gauge measurement biases of wind-induced undercatch, wetting losses, and trace amount of precipitation for the last 30 years. These corrections have increased the gauge-measured monthly precipitation significantly by up to 22 mm for winter months, and slightly by about 5 mm during summer season. Relatively, the correction factors (CF) are small in summer (10%), and very large in winter (80&#8211;120%) because of the increased effect of wind on gauge undercatch of snowfall. The CFs also vary over space particularly in snowfall season. Significant CF differences were found across the USA/Canada borders mainly due to differences in catch efficiency between the national gauges. Bias corrections generally enhance monthly precipitation trends by 5&#8211;20%. These results point to a need to review our current understanding of the Arctic fresh water budget and its change.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we used numerical models to investigate weekday to weekend ozone differences in the Los Angeles (LA) basin in 1997 and 2010. We developed relatively complete descriptions of weekday to weekend emission changes for nitrogen oxides (NOx) with 80% of the weekday NOx emissions receiving a weekend adjustment in 1997 and 67% in 2010. Weekend NOx decreases of 34% on Saturday and 45% on Sunday relative to weekdays for 1997 are predicted to become slightly greater by 2010 and are dominated by NOx decreases for on-road vehicles (especially heavy-duty diesel vehicles) and off-road construction equipment. Weekend anthropogenic reactive organic gas (ROG) decreases for 1997 (12% on Saturday and 16% on Sunday) are smaller than for NOx and become even smaller in 2010. However, there is less certainty in the weekend ROG emission changes because only 47% of the weekday ROG emissions received a weekend adjustment in 1997 and only 21% in 2010. The ozone modeling used multiple representations of the meteorology and chemistry in order to identify results that are consistent across these inputs. Weekend ozone increased in central portions of the basin in response to weekend NOx and ROG decreases for both 1997 and 2010, with both the SAPRC99 and CB4 chemical mechanisms, and with all meteorological data sets. Weekend ozone decreased in other portions of the basin in all models. Comparing 2010 to 1997, weekend ozone increases are smaller and confined to smaller portions of the LA basin near the Pacific coast, whereas weekend ozone decreases are larger and more widespread in 2010. For 2010, all models show lower 8-h ozone on Sunday than weekdays in the Riverside/San Bernardino area. First-order sensitivity analysis (via the decoupled direct method) shows that the weekday/weekend ozone changes are mainly due to the NOx emission changes. Also, the weekday/weekend ozone changes for 2010 are sensitive to the choice of initial and boundary concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study we present the seasonal variability of ozone production efficiencies (E-N), defined as the net number of ozone molecules produced per molecule of nitrogen oxides ( nitrogen oxide ( NO) + nitrogen dioxide (NO2)= NOx) oxidized to NOz ( total reactive nitrogen (NOy) - NOx) determined from field measurements of a seven-year period ( 1998 - 2004) at the Swiss high-alpine research station Jungfraujoch (JFJ), 3580ma. s. l. This dataset is a unique long-term data series of nitrogen levels in the free troposphere over Central Europe and hence it offers an excellent opportunity to perform such an analysis and provide further evidence to the photochemical origin of the ozone spring maximum at locations of the northern hemisphere distant from nearby pollution sources. Experimentally derived daily EN values have been selected for 571 days out of the 2557 days from 1998 to 2004, from which an average ozone production efficiency of 18.8 +/- 1.3 molecules of O-3 produced per molecule of NOx oxidized was calculated. This value indicates the great potential and importance of photochemical ozone production in the free troposphere. The monthly means of experimentally derived daily E-N values show a seasonal variation with lower values from May to August, which can be probably attributed to more efficient vertical transport of polluted air masses from the atmospheric boundary layer up to JFJ. In agreement, theoretically derived monthly E-N values show similar seasonal variation. The ratio NOy/CO, a parameter to assess the aging process that has occurred in an air parcel, was used as a criterion to disaggregate the 571 selected days between undisturbed and disturbed free tropospheric ( FT). The monthly means of experimentally derived E-N values for the undisturbed FT conditions show a distinct seasonal cycle with higher values in the cold season from November to April. The E-N values for undisturbed FT conditions are particularly higher than the respective monthly E-N values for disturbed FT conditions from February to October. It should be noted that the monthly E-N values of March (E-N= 35.8) and April (E-N= 34.9) are among the highest values throughout the year for undisturbed FT conditions at JFJ. These results highlight the key and possibly the dominant role for photochemistry in the observed build-up of tropospheric ozone in the winter-spring transition period.},

For the uppermost cloud layer, the layer seen by a satellite instrument, the original REMO cloud scheme gives an ice cloud cover amount of about 90%, and the water cloud cover is close to zero. As compared with ISCCP, this result is an overestimation of ice clouds by up to 60% and underestimation of water clouds by up to 40%. To improve the REMO cloud results, a sensitivity study is carried out that shows that ice heterogeneous nucleation is the most influential process in the REMO cloud scheme. Cloud properties derived from the new REMO cloud scheme show that the amount of grid-scale ice clouds has decreased by about 40% and that of grid-scale water clouds has increased by about 20% in comparison with the old version. When compared with the ISCCP cloud retrievals, the new cloud scheme shows a general improvement, but the amount of ice clouds is still up to 20% higher, and that of water clouds can still be underestimated by about 20%. The total cloud cover for the month of March is reduced to 80%, the same amount as derived from the ISCCP retrievals. In addition, REMO cloud-top heights as compared with ISCCP retrieval and the REMO precipitation as compared with ground observations have also improved in the new version of REMO.},

  Abstract                 = {Many regional climate models (RCM) and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models use old aerosol data sets to calculate the direct aerosol effect. In this study, three multi-year simulations with COSMO-CLM using different aerosol climatologies and a simulation with monthly mean aerosol optical properties, stemming from a COSMO-CLM simulation with coupled aerosol microphysics and transport, are evaluated. The climatologies of Tegen et al. (1997), the AEROCOM-climatology for present-day conditions, and the monthly mean optical properties from Zubler et al. (2011), with realistic patterns of aerosol optical depth (AOD), lead to an increase of downward surface shortwave radiation (SSR) of 35 W m−2 (20%) in the Mediterranean region in comparison with the climatology of Tanré et al. (1984). The former is known to strongly overestimate AOD over Europe. The associated bias in SSR exceeds the observed variations of the recent decades by up to a factor 5. Despite an annual mean temperature increase of 0.5 K above Southern European land surfaces owing to enhanced SSR, the newer climatologies yield colder temperatures in the mid-troposphere because of a reduction of the shortwave absorption by desert dust. This reduced heating destabilizes the atmosphere relative to the simulation with the climatology of Tanré et al. (1984), enhancing cloud formation and precipitation in these simulations.
