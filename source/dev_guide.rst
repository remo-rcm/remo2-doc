Developer Guide
===============


In this chapter, a brief introduction into *how to contribute* to remo should be provided. Since
the latest release of remo and the ongoing refactoring, the model code structure has changed. If you 
have not worked with the model since REMO2015 :cite:`Jacob2012`, you might ask, what have changed.
The main idea behind the new model version is to make the model more easy to maintain and extend.
During the development, we try to keep in mind the *open-closed princple* which mainly
states that "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, 
but closed for modification" [#martin_open_closed]_.
